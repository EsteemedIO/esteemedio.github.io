Ah, Slack. A recruiter’s (often overlooked) best friend. This corporate communication tool has become the go-to messaging app for businesses and developers alike. Slack is used by the [majority](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/slack-has-10-million-daily-active-users){:target='_blank'} of Fortune 100 companies, and the app boasts users like Amazon, PayPal, IBM, and Oracle. Users spend, on average, an [hour and a half](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm){:target='_blank'} each day on Slack.

Slack’s early adopters and biggest fans are mainly software developers. Over half a million registered developers use the app, and there are plenty of communities catering to the digital professional.

These stats make it obvious as to why recruiters benefit from Slack’s [talent sourcing](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/09/09/how-digital-talent-sourcing-can-help-you-avoid-bad-hires/){:target='_blank'} potential — especially when it comes to filling tech positions. Read on to learn more about using Slack for recruiting.

### **Why is Slack Good for Recruiting Freelancers?**

Why else is Slack a good medium for recruiting freelancers? For one, digital professionals are already using it for office productivity. Daily, and for upwards of [seven and a half hours](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm){:target='_blank'} each week. LinkedIn, on the other hand, reports that users spend only [17 minutes](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/01/05/social-media-marketing-statistics){:target='_blank'} on its platform _each month_. It’s simple: **if you want to connect with the digital workforce, go where the people are.**

Slack is **popular with developers and other IT professionals** (who are notorious for leaving recruiting emails and LinkedIn messages unopened). If you’re looking for tech talent, Slack is a powerful tool to help you reach them, and, more importantly, engage them.

Other social networking sites have a tendency to get too “noisy.” Articles, videos, advertising, and complicated algorithms that throw chronology to the wind when displaying one’s news feed… it’s neither direct nor to the point. Slack is.

What’s more, **communication is more natural** on Slack than on other mediums. It follows the preferred choice of communication we have with people we _know_ (texting family, friends, etc.) so there’s an added layer of comfortability and trust built-in subconsciously. If you think about the way in which you correspond with coworkers and acquaintances, emails often sound sterile: opening with a “_Dear Michelle,_” (or the ever-so-robotic “_To whom it may concern_”) and closing with an “_I’ll be sure to follow up with you._” The exact same sentiments, if communicated through Slack, would be more along the lines of: “_Hey,_” and “_Let’s chat tomorrow._”

Because of this more comfortable communication, recruiters are **more likely to engage prospects** in a Slack conversation than receive an email response.

### **How to Use Slack to Recruit Tech Talent**

#### 1. Search for the right channels

Slack channels are essentially groups. If you’re a tech recruiter [looking for developer talent](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/09/21/creating-a-candidate-persona/){:target='_blank'}, consider joining channels like #developers or [this](https://devopschat.co/){:target='_blank'} DevOps community. Chances are, you can find a channel _filled_ with candidates for whatever position it is you’re looking to fill.

If your company relies on Slack internally, create a referral channel for your employees. Any time you have an opening, announce the position to your channel so your team can refer candidates.

#### 2. Establish yourself in the community

As with any other social platform, you’ll get more out of Slack if you participate. Join discussions, ask questions, and offer insight.

#### 3. Post your job openings

This goes without saying. If you’re using Slack for recruiting, you’ll need to share the positions for which you’re hiring. Whether it’s a [contract position or a full-time hire](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/08/03/should-i-consider-contract-staffing/){:target='_blank'}, you’ll find willing candidates to engage with on the platform. Post your open positions to various channels, and follow up with people who express interest. Slack has a useful “thread” feature, which allows you to have organized side conversations even as the channel feed continues messaging.

#### 4. Coordinate logistics

Create private channels for your internal team as you embark on the hiring process. Here you can prep your interviewers and discuss pertinent information to keep your recruiters up-to-speed. Determine salary thresholds in real-time, collaborate on timelines, and discuss feedback together. Not only will everything be neatly organized, but all of this information is readily accessible if you need to revisit it. Slack has a [/remind feature](https://slack.com/intl/en-it/blog/productivity/never-forget-the-little-things-with-remind){:target='_blank'} that can be employed here. Push reminders of upcoming events/action items to your team so that nothing falls through the cracks. Or, depending upon how extensive your needs are, you can choose from a variety of recruitment apps and productivity tools that integrate with Slack (such as the Esteemed Talent Network app).

#### 5. Keep your candidates in the loop

The best recruiters know the value of keeping potential candidates informed throughout the hiring process. Slack simplifies this. Maintain a level of contact while searching for your next hire by shooting each candidate a quick message - thanking them, requesting additional details, etc. When your new hire accepts your job offer, you can quickly begin the [onboarding](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/10/21/an-80-point-employee-onboarding-checklist-for-long-term-success/){:target='_blank'} process and introduce them to the rest of your team.

#### 6. Speed up the hiring process to avoid losing your candidates to competitors

Between Slack’s organizational capabilities and real-time conversations, your [talent sourcing](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/09/09/how-digital-talent-sourcing-can-help-you-avoid-bad-hires/){:target='_blank'} and recruiting processes will be more efficient and effective. This, in turn, means that you can reduce your time to hire by 3 percent, according to [Slack](https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/marketing/downloads/resources/rebrand/IDC_The_Business_Value_of_Slack.pdf){:target='_blank'}.
