Fractional screening is a great side hustle for web engineers with skills, experience, and some free time in their schedules. Screeners can earn additional income while using their skills to match open roles with qualified developers among their colleagues. Hiring organizations also benefit from this arrangement because they can evaluate a larger pool of potential candidates by leveraging fractional screeners to help manage their recruiting efforts and resources.

## **What is Fractional Screening?**

The traditional recruitment process is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. It requires a lot of human resources to manage the administration process for interviewing candidates and filtering out those who are not qualified despite the advances with AI sourcing tools. This is especially true for technical positions, where there are often hundreds of applicants.

Fractional screening is a recruitment outsourcing option that leverages professional developers with a niche or advanced technical knowledge to tackle the vetting and prequalifying filtration step during the candidate assessment process.

Fractional screeners are highly skilled professional developers who can provide technical interviewer services that can accurately evaluate candidates' skills and abilities based on their experience in a particular technology, language, or platform.

When hiring managers fold fractional screening into their wheelhouse of technical screening tools it gives them access to many qualified candidates at a fraction of what it would typically cost to vet technical candidates internally. Without losing control over their organization's recruiting process or sacrificing quality assurance, it alleviates the burden of screening and evaluating candidates.

## **Why Should I Find a Fractional Screening Gig?**

If you're an experienced developer, this is an excellent way to earn extra income for **paid interviews** while providing your skills and expertise to companies that need them. If you haven't considered fractional screening as an opportunity in the past, consider the numerous benefits a fractional screening gig has to offer.

### **Financial Stability**

As a fractional worker, you can combine multiple streams of income. This means that you can earn money whenever and wherever you want. You'll be able to find work as needed and take on projects when you have time.

### **Flexibility**

Fractional workers have more control over their schedules. You set your hours and work on your schedule. You can choose which projects you want to work on, thus giving you more control over how much money you earn each month. This is especially important if you have other responsibilities outside of work, such as caring for children or elderly family members.

It's particularly appealing if you want to work part-time while continuing your full-time, attending school full-time or part-time, or taking the time to pursue personal goals.

### **Control**

As a fractional worker you’ll have the ability to choose how much or how little you want to work. You can set your schedule so that it fits into your life. You can even take breaks during the week if necessary. You’ll also have the freedom to choose the types of assignments most appealing.. You'll have access to thousands of jobs and can apply for whatever projects interest you most. The pay is often more competitive than full-time positions, so even if the hours don't match up perfectly with your schedule, it's still worth considering as an alternative to a full-time job. As a fractional screener, you'll be able to pick the jobs you want to do and the companies you want to engage for business, allowing control and freedom to manage your schedule.

### **Work from Anywhere**

As the remote-hybrid paradigm takes hold, working from anywhere has become more important. This is simply good business practice because several studies have shown a large portion of the workforce claim that remote work allows them to be more productive. For example, 77% of those who work remotely at least a few times per month show increased productivity, with 30% doing more work in less time and 24% doing more in the same period, [according to a survey by ConnectSolutions](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/technology/pages/teleworkers-more-productive-even-when-sick.aspx).
