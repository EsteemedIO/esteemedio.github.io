## **What Are the Types of Fractional Executives**?

The C-level acts as the chief executives in a company, driving their organizations to grow and leading operational changes to remain competitive.

* CTO (Chief Technology Officer)
* CIO (Chief Information office)
* CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)

Today, a wide range of C-level titles spin off these traditional acronyms. With so many variations for the chief executive label available, CXO is now a known term with the "X" representing the collective term for C-level or C-suite executive. Sometimes roles overlap, and it's not uncommon for executives to wear multiple hats.

For example, an IT executive could take on the part of a CIO or CTO, or both. CIOs typically oversee IT departments and make strategic decisions about an organization's hardware and software associated with networking systems, work staff, and customer service needs. CTOs typically focus more on the innovation aspects of the business. They oversee a business's existing and new technology needs to develop strategic products and services. Their goal is to help grow business while keeping an eye on maintaining and optimizing technology infrastructure.
