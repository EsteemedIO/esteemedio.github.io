If you’re wondering what _exactly_ the difference between a senior developer and a junior developer is, we’re here to supply you with an answer. Oftentimes, we get this question when a company is building out their hiring requirements for a new IT role opening up within their organization. As they determine their candidate “must-haves” for a developer position, some recruiters have to ask: are they looking for a junior or senior developer, or does the distinction even play into their needs at all?

### Senior Developers vs. Junior Developers

On the one hand, a senior developer ought to have more extensive experience, and more time for their education and skill sets to have been tested, than a junior developer. On the other hand, an accumulation of hours doesn’t translate to a more talented developer.

Here at Esteemed, our team works primarily with developers. Different employers will come to us with different requirements. Progressive companies often weigh skill over experience, but many businesses still also look directly at how many years a developer has been working. Whether right or wrong, it's still pretty prevalent, and everybody seems to have a bit of a different definition of what really constitutes “senior.” The rule of thumb is that a junior developer usually has 1-2 years of experience, a mid-level developer has 2-5 years, and a senior developer has over 5 years of experience under their belt. This range varies from company to company, so take that as a general guideline.

When our team works with clients looking to hire either a junior or senior developer, we make the conscious decision to evaluate candidates based on both experience and skill. Unless a role specifically mentions “Senior Experience” as a non-negotiable requirement, we recommend candidates based on their skill level. This way, we’re able to [place skilled candidates in roles](https://esteemed.io/screening/) that will give them more experience. (And, to be honest, we got tired of recommending senior developers, who certainly had the necessary amount of experience, just for them to get turned down for roles because their skills weren’t the right fit for the requirements). We see the most success this way.

Just because our company’s screening policy allows us the freedom to emphasize skill level over years of experience for internal roles, doesn’t mean we automatically apply it to all of our clients. As we’ve mentioned, different employers will come to us with different requirements for open roles, and we don't have much influence over what they say they’re looking for. That being said, if an employer finds a developer role difficult to fill, we’ll often advise them to tweak their requirements to open the doors for better-fitting candidates.
