It's a chance to get away from the day-to-day routine and focus on what matters most – connection among teams and company priorities. With all the daily distractions and demands at your home office or hybrid workplace, it can be hard to find the time to reflect on your work goals.

### **1. Build Company Culture**

Leaders need to keep their workforce updated with the company vision and objectives to maintain a strong culture and keep people focused on the same goals, which creates better outcomes for success.

When managing a remote team or hybrid organization, building culture and creating a collective employee experience with a shared vision can be challenging.
