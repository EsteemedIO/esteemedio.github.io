# Code of Conduct

As our community grows, it’s important that we preserve the things that bring us together; namely, keeping Esteemed a fun, open, rewarding experience. Our Code of Conduct is an expression of our ideals, not a rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the entire Esteemed community.

The current admins are:
* Julia Panchenko
* Chris McGrath
* Matthew Ellis Pritchard
* Jenny Lam

We want this to be a pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Confidentiality

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

### Harassment

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion

* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment

* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names

* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate

* Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop

* Threats of violence

* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm

* Deliberate intimidation

* Sustained disruption of discussion

* Unwelcome sexual attention

* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

* Publication of non-harassing private communication

### Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.

### Credits & License

This code of conduct is based on the one developed by Ubuntu, with the addition of the Conflict Resolution Policy developed by the Drupal Community. We have adapted the Drupal Code of Conduct and the Slack Code of Conduct for our own use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.
