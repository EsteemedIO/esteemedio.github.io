    <p class="h5 main-text-description">
At Esteemed, we are changing the way highly-skilled IT talent is found, by taking a community-driven approach!<br/>
    </p>

	<p class="h5 main-text-description">
Because of that, we want to make sure you are rewarded for your efforts beyond your day job! We are rolling out a bonus program for our members who want to flex their entrepreneurial muscles, and further both the company we’re building, and their own personal income.
    </p>

	<p class="h5 main-text-description">
<b>We realize most of our team are contacted by recruiters, agencies, and companies looking to employ them on a regular basis.</b> We hope to partner with our member and employee partners to grow our business to new heights, by capturing that intel, and putting it to good use, expanding our client base.
    </p>
    
    <p class="h5 main-text-description">
 If you bring us information that leads to us filling a job, we will <b>pay you a monthly commission for referrals</b>, based on the profit margin generated for up to 18 months!
    </p>
    
     <p class="h5 main-text-description">
We will also be running open training sessions each month with our VP, Rob Schaust, giving you methods and advice to capture great information effectively and efficiently. Join as many, or as few, of these as you’d like.
    </p>
