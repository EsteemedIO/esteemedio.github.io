title: 'Technical Screening in 2022: 15 Methods for Assessing Senior and Junior Developers'
description: Selecting the right technical screening methods to properly assess the
  skill and experience level of job applicants during the hiring process can help
  to distinguish between Junior developers and Senior developers. It's important to
  understand the job description and requirements for the role you need to fill, so
  you don't try to hire an under-qualified Junior for a Senior role, or expect a Senior
  to work for a Junior pay rate.
