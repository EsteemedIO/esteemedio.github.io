description: Selecting the right technical screening methods to properly assess the
  skill and experience level of job applicants during the hiring process can help
  to distinguish between Junior developers and Senior developers. It's important to
  understand the job description and requirements for the role you need to fill, so
  you don't try to hire an under-qualified Junior for a Senior role, or expect a Senior
  to work for a Junior pay rate.

At Esteemed, we’re _very_ interested in building a community amongst our peers. Our goal is to get to know our colleagues as well as we possibly can, so that we can market them in the best way possible, while also providing our clientele with the confidence of high quality talent.

Last week our marketing director wanted to get a list of people who haven’t yet uploaded an image of their smiling faces. Easy enough, I thought. Having already worked extensively with Slack’s API, I thought that surely I would be able to filter users by a flag within the user objects.
