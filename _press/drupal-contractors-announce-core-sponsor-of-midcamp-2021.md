Join [Drupal Contractors](https://www.drupalcontractors.com) at Midwest Drupal Camp (known also as [MidCamp](https://www.midcamp.org/)) for the Chicago-area’s eighth annual Drupal “unconference” March 24–27, 2021. Drupal Contractors is a sponsor of this year’s (virtual) event, and we couldn’t be more excited for MidCamp 2021. Developers, designers, users, and Drupal enthusiasts from the Midwest and beyond will convene for four days of learning, networking, socializing, and contributing to the wonderful world of Drupal.

This year’s admission is pay-what-you-want. In keeping with their belief that quality Drupal events should be accessible to everyone, MidCamp 2021 is free to those in need. Here at Drupal Contractors we aim to support the Drupal community, which is why we’ve proudly stepped up as a core sponsor in an effort to further MidCamp’s mission. If you’re able, event organizers recommend a $20 donation when you register. All ticket proceeds will be used to offset expenses as well as make charitable donations to worthwhile organizations. [Get your tickets here](https://ti.to/midcamp/2021).

Because MidCamp 2021 is virtual, all scheduled sessions will be hosted on Zoom. Networking and socialization will take place in [Gather Town](https://gather.town/). In addition, attendees can ask questions and make text-based conversation in the [MidCamp Slack](https://mid.camp/slack) channel. Combine these platforms with events such as pet cams, virtual game night, karaoke, and even a [walking tour](https://www.midcamp.org/2021/topic-proposal/lets-go-walk), and you’ve got the next best thing to an in-person unconference!

Attendees will have the opportunity to network with Drupal service providers, hosting vendors, fellow Drupal users, and the web development community at-large. If you’re interested in Drupal, MidCamp 2021 is the perfect event to attend. Read on for more information, or [click here](https://ti.to/midcamp/2021) to register.
