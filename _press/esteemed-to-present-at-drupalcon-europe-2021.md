DrupalCon Europe 2021 is fast approaching, and we’re eager to share the news: three of our own are presenting at this year’s premier European Drupal event. The global conference starts Monday, October 4 and runs through Thursday, October 7. As with last year’s event, DrupalCon Europe 2021 will be fully virtual, but _unlike_ last year, the event will collaborate with local camps that offer limited in-person experiences and exchanges.

As the event organizers explain, “DrupalCon Europe 2021 brings together the European Community (and beyond) by hosting regional camps online at the main event. A single DrupalCon ticket gives you access to all events \[on all days\]. Camps craft their own experiences \[and\] host their own sessions, interviews, and case studies.” Drupal founder, Dries Buytaert, will be among the keynote speakers. For a complete DrupalCon Europe 2021 schedule, visit the official [conference website](https://events.drupal.org/europe2021/schedule/all).

Attendees can choose from 90 sessions, panels, and workshops across the following five tracks:

* Agency and Business (focusing on sustainable, innovative, and diversifying practices)
* Clients and Industry Experiences (examining case studies and real-world experiences)
* Makers and Builders (combining DevOps, backend development, site building, front end development, and accessibility competencies)
* Open Web and Community (exploring the human element of our digital landscape)
* Users and Editors (focusing on using Drupal to reach goals, create content, and design user experiences)

To register for DrupalCon Europe 2021, [click here](https://events.drupal.org/europe2021/registration-information). As you build your schedule, don’t forget to add these three sessions, led by our Esteemed colleagues:

### 1. [Finding Drupal Talent in a Seller's Market](https://events.drupal.org/europe2021/sessions/finding-drupal-talent-sellers-market)

Esteemed CEO (and longtime tech leader, web developer, digital strategist, and technical architect) Chris McGrath will lead a session entitled, “Finding Drupal Talent in a Seller’s Market.” This topic is part of DrupalCon Europe’s Agency and Business track, and will be held on Wednesday, October 6 from 1–1:45 pm UTC in Hopin Room 5.

As the session title suggests, attendees can expect to learn about best practices, tips, and insider tricks for sourcing and recruiting top Drupal talent in today’s challenging hiring climate. IT roles (especially developers, architects, and engineers) are increasingly difficult to fill. Why? A widening skills gap coupled with an explosive growth in the number of open positions for digital roles means that it’s a seller’s market. Finding top tech talent in these conditions ⁠and vying for seasoned IT professionals with a growing number of competitors ⁠_is challenging_. McGrath will outline proven strategies on how best to position your company to attract and retain top Drupal talent. If your company is looking for Drupal pros, you won’t want to miss this session!

### 2. [Machine Learning in Drupal with Tensorflow.js](https://events.drupal.org/europe2021/sessions/machine-learning-drupal-tensorflowjs)

On Thursday, October 7 from 7–7:45 am UTC, join Rick Torzynski in Hopin Room 3 for a Makers and Builders session aptly named “Machine Learning in Drupal with Tensorflow.js.” Torzynski holds over 12 years of Drupal experience and spends his free time working on IoT devices, and has a gift for making machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts more accessible.

Attendees who join this session will gain insight into ML and deep learning and how Drupal uses these disciplines. And, since ML and AI jobs have jumped by roughly 75 percent in the past few years, investing in these high-growth technologies is a smart bet. Join Torzynski to learn more about current ML modules in Drupal, the role of Python and Jupyter Notebooks in ML, and how TensorFlow.jw facilitates ML-processing _directly in Drupal_.

### 3. [Building a Mindset for Technical Leadership (Workshop)](https://events.drupal.org/europe2021/sessions/building-mindset-technical-leadership-workshop)

Last but certainly not least, be sure to check out Dori Kelner’s “Building a Mindset for Technical Leadership” workshop, held in Hopin Room 6 on Wednesday, October 6 from 2–2:45 pm UTC.

Kelner will assist attendees in exploring mindfulness training as a way in which to learn how tech leaders can build resilience and compassion in times of uncertainty. Prominent organizations (including Google) use this training to enhance their workplace culture and foster compassion, creativity, and healthy habits. Included in this workshop will be a short mindfulness session accompanied by a discussion (facilitated by a certified mindfulness teacher). 

The team at Esteemed looks forward to joining you at these sessions and throughout the entire DrupalCon Europe 2021 event! To learn more about who we are and what we do, [check us out or drop us a line](https://esteemed.io/).
