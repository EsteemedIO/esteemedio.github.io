Esteemed is proud to support this year’s [DrupalCon North America 2021](https://events.drupal.org/northamerica2021) as a Bronze sponsor. Join us for a virtual conference from Monday, April 12 through Friday, April 16, 2021 from 11am to 3pm ET daily. While there are Drupal Camps, meetups, and community events scheduled throughout the year (and across the globe), DrupalCon is the largest such event. In the words of DrupalCon 2021 organizers, “DrupalCon provides the stage for exploring the most ambitious and cutting edge case studies, inspiring others to take their work to the next level, and offering to prospective users, a glimpse into ‘the art of the possible’ when you choose Drupal.”

For a week in April, developers, content strategists, designers, editors, end-users and more will convene to see the best that Drupal has to offer. We’re excited to announce that two members of our Esteemed team, [Chris McGrath](https://www.drupal.org/u/chris-mcgrath) and [Dori Kelner](https://www.drupal.org/u/dmkelner), will speak at the event. Registration information, speaker details, and a complete list of sessions can be found [here](https://events.drupal.org/northamerica2021).

### DrupalCon 2021 Overview

Here’s what to expect at DrupalCon 2021. The daily event schedule will be packed with informative sessions, and there will be ample opportunity to network and socialize. The keynote speech will be delivered by Drupal's founder, Dries Buytaert.

Session tracks include content surrounding:

* Community Health
* Content & Marketing
* Core Contributions
* DevOps
* Development & Coding
* Drupal Showcase
* Drupal and Open Source 101
* Site Building
* User Experience, Accessibility & Design
* Being Human, Contributions, & Community

#### Session: Stressed? It’s Time to Reclaim Your Focus

Stress can either be a healthy motivator or a crippling experience. On Tuesday, April 13 at 12:15pm ET, join Esteemed member and founder of [Insightful Culture](https://www.insightfulculture.com/) Dori Kelner as she hosts an interactive hour of mindfulness practices and stress management tips. Kelner has decades of experience in the IT and digital space, and has led sessions at DrupalCon, DrupalGovCon, various Drupal Camps, Association of Media & Publishing, User Experience Professional Association, and other digital meetings and conferences.

Many distinguished organizations (including companies such as Google, Ford, General Mills, Goldman Sachs, and Aetna) offer mindfulness training to their employees in an effort to combat unwanted effects of stress. Left untreated, stress impairs critical thinking, clouds focus, and reduces concentration. In this DrupalCon session, Kelner will walk attendees through the science of stress and explore simple techniques to sharpen your mind as you work.

#### Session: Finding Drupal Talent in a Seller’s Market

Digital technologists are in high demand. As this profession grows in popularity, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find top-tier, high-performing talent. Esteemed CEO Chris McGrath will lead a DrupalCon session on Friday, April 16 from 1:45pm to 1:55pm ET. In this presentation, McGrath will address proven strategies for securing top Drupal talent in a digital landscape where companies (large and small alike) are struggling to find the right people for the job. If your organization is experiencing considerable growth or has unfilled digital technology positions, this session is for you. McGrath will explain how best to position yourself as an employer seeking Drupal and related digital talent, and will offer tips and tricks he’s learned in the nearly two decades he’s worked in digital design, web development, communications, branding, and business — spanning both technical and managerial roles.

We’re excited for this year’s week-long DrupalCon and hope to see you there!
