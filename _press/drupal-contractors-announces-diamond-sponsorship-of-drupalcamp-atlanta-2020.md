This year’s featured speakers include AmyJune Hineline, Jim Vomero, Mario Hernandez, and Iwantha Lekamge. Matt Obert and Tyler Ashbaugh of Drupal Contractors will also present tutorials at this year’s camp. More information about their sessions can be found below.

DigitalCamp Atlanta is a two-day conference being hosted on Thursday, September 10 and Friday, September 11, 2020. Thursday’s schedule will include half-day trainings and sessions, and Friday will have additional sessions and a Career Summit.

* Setting up simplesamlphp as a Service Provider
* Setting up simplesamlphp as an Identity Provider
* Common pitfalls of enabling SSO in Drupal 7/8

### [Drupal Behaviors for Data Protection](https://www.drupalcampatlanta.com/2020/sessions/drupal-behaviors-data-protection){:target='_blank'}

Friday, September 11 | 1:00 - 1:45pm

This session is tailored to attendees with an intermediate level of Drupal experience. Join Matt Obert of Drupal Contractors as he discusses using Drupal Behaviors and contributed modules in order to achieve data protection compliance. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are two examples of recent legislation aimed at restricting the ways in which companies can legally track site visitors. Obert will demonstrate how contributed modules for Drupal 7, 8, and 9 can help developers achieve basic regulatory compliance. In addition, he’ll show attendees how to achieve strict compliance by writing Drupal Behaviors in a custom module.
