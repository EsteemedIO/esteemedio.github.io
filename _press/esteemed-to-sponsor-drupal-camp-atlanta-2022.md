### [How to Lead a Human-Centric Workplace](https://www.drupalcampatlanta.com/2022/sessions/how-lead-human-centric-workplace){:target='_blank'}

Friday, September 16 | 9:00 - 9:45pm

Cutting-edge organizations are turning their focus toward humanizing workplaces and improving the support they offer employees and contractors alike.

When the workplace offers clear purpose, open discussion, and psychological safety, team members will thrive. But what does that mean for the organization? Reduced turnover, greater productivity, enhanced relationships, and overall happier people.

To accomplish this, let's examine the root of the organizational culture - leadership. When leaders are authentic, trusting, and open, everyone in the organization will instinctively model the attitude of their leaders. These changes ripple throughout the company, resulting in a happier, more engaged workforce, ready to execute and perform at a higher level.

Come join us to learn how to create both success and happiness in your organization by embracing humanistic leadership.

Attendees of this session will walk away with:

* An understanding of the human-centric workplace and how it benefits your organization
* Valuing the importance of your team members’ unique perspectives and needs
* How changing your habitual patterns of thinking will build greater connectedness, resilience, and kindness

### [Building Awareness and Intention into Your Developer Career Journey](https://www.drupalcampatlanta.com/2022/sessions/building-awareness-and-intention-your-developer-career-journey){:target='_blank'}

Friday, September 16 | 3:00 - 3:45pm

When trying to make the most of your career, determining what to prioritize can be difficult. You might find yourself asking questions like, "Should I prioritize my current clients? Should I look to new clients for growth?" At times, the list of questions and things to do may feel endless.

This endless cycle causes frustration and burnout, resulting in the inability to make the most of our career. Whether it's growth problems, or feeling you've reached a plateau, this talk will help you to build awareness and intentionality into all your career decisions moving forward.

We'll start by identifying skill gaps, across both hard- and soft-skills, and learning how to fill in those gaps without having to turn to sources other than yourself to find the best answers.

During the session, you'll learn the following:

* How to maximize your growth with a few simple steps and principles
* How to take that knowledge and turn it into action
* How to start acting on the knowledge after the session ends
