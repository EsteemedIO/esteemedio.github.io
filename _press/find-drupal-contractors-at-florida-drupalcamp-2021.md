Join us at Florida DrupalCamp 2021 (FLDC) for the Sunshine State’s annual web development “unconference.” From Thursday, February 18 through Saturday, February 20, FLDC is going virtual with training events, informational sessions, and a contribution day.

Florida DrupalCamp is a community-led event designed to bring local web developers and Drupal enthusiasts together for three days of learning and networking. Attendees will have access to presentations, full- and half-day training workshops, a (virtual) after-hours party, and the following session tracks:

* Design, Theming, and Usability
* Development and Performance
* Sessions off the Drupal Island
* Site Building
* Project Management, Sales, and Consulting

[Drupal Contractors](https://www.drupalcontractors.com/){:target='_blank'} is proud to announce that we’ve partnered with Florida DrupalCamp as a Gold sponsor. Two of our members, Chris McGrath and Gloria Tucker, have been chosen as speakers for the event. Below, you can find details for each session:

This project management- and consulting-themed FLDC session, led by Chris McGrath, is designed for all audiences.

Connecting with the right person at the right time can have profound implications on your career/company growth. This talk explores the powerful relationship between mentors and mentees, and focuses on learning how to guide yourself and others on the path to success.

In this session, attendees will have a chance to learn about the importance of mentor/mentee relationships in the Drupal community and hear about the various tools and resources available for improving such relationships. In addition, Chris will walk attendees through potential Drupal and engineering mentorship obstacles and how to overcome them.
