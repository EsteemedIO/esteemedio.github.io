This year’s New England Drupal Camp 2021, better known as NEDCamp, will be held virtually on Friday, November 19, 2021, from 9:30am - 5:00pm ET. Esteemed is proud to be a Digital Sponsor for the event to not only further the NEDCamp cause (growing Drupal expertise and community in the New England area) but to ensure that any Drupal enthusiast can attend. The registration cost for NEDCamp 2021 is “pay-what-you-want,” and tickets can be obtained [here](https://ti.to/nedcamp/2021ticket).

After careful consideration, the organizers of NEDCamp 2021 have come to the conclusion that it remains unfeasible to have an in-person event, so the entirety of the single-day conference will take place on Zoom. Attendees can join the #nedcamp channel on the [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/user/login?destination=join-slack) group for assistance, conversation, and networking.

Highlights of this year’s event will include BoF sessions (exploring topics like Drupal and modern Javascript, intranet/web portal design, Drupal 8 end-of-life, and more), an introductory training course for Drupal newcomers, a keynote speech by radio host and motivational speaker Courtney Kelley Bedard, and a virtual afterparty to end the day.

### Training: Getting Started with Drupal

##### Friday, November 19, 2021 | 10:00 - 11:45am ET

Join _Evolving Web_ cofounder Suzanne Dergacheva at 10:00am ET for a nearly two hour [introductory training session](https://nedcamp.org/trainings/2021/training-getting-started-drupal) that will focus on best practices and helpful information for those new to Drupal. In this session, attendees will learn about the basics of Drupal and how to benefit from the open-source project and the extensive community that has been built up around it. Dergacheva will address the current and forecasted career prospects for Drupal talent and offer actionable ways in which Drupal professionals can advance in their chosen field and differentiate themselves from the competition.

### Keynote: The Time is Now — Let’s Get to It

##### Friday, November 19, 2021 | 1:00 - 1:45pm ET

Clinician and on-air personality Courtney Kelley Bedard will deliver NEDCamp 2021’s [keynote](https://nedcamp.org/) address. Given the challenging, exhausting, and uncertainty of the past year and a half as we’ve navigated our way through this pandemic, we could all use some inspiration. Bedard plans to use this session to address the elephant in the room: the overwhelming division, depletion, and procrastination so many of us are trying to keep at bay. Attendees take notes: despite the circumstances that have led us here, Bedard intends to explain why _now_ “may actually be the most ideal time to take action,” and which tools we’ll need to set ourselves back on the right track. Join this session to be inspired and come away with simple and effective ways to manage time, stress, and shifting priorities.
