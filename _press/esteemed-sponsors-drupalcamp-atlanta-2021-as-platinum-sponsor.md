We’re pleased to announce that Esteemed is a Platinum sponsor for DrupalCamp Atlanta (DCATL) for 2021. The two-day annual Drupal conference (one of the southeast’s largest) will be held virtually on Thursday, September 9 and Friday, September 10. 

This year’s conference is expected to attract hundreds of developers, designers, business leaders, and Drupal aficionados of all levels. The DCATL summit offers attendees the opportunity to join half-day hands-on trainings and sessions centered around business leadership, development and performance, design/theming and usability, site building, marketing, being human (people operations), future of Drupal, and education. As the organizers of DCATL note, “Not only is \[the conference\] a chance to expand your knowledge of Drupal, it's also a chance to make lasting connections within a community that welcomes all.”

In addition to our Platinum sponsorship of DCATL, Esteemed CEO Chris McGrath is leading a Business Leadership session for beginners on how best to find Drupal talent in today’s world. To register for the conference, [click here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/drupalcamp-2021-tickets-159695117395). General admission costs $50, and training sessions are an additional $25.

### Finding Drupal Talent in a Seller's Market

McGrath will outline proven strategies on how employers can best position themselves when looking for top Drupal talent, as demand for digital technologists continues to outpace supply.
