Drupal Camp Asheville 2020 will be held virtually from Friday, July 10 to Saturday, July 11. Join Drupal Contractors and your local Drupal community as we embark on a two-day “unconference” filled with hands-on training, community collaboration, and networking for Drupal enthusiasts of all levels. This year, Drupal Camp Asheville will celebrate its tenth anniversary.

In furthering our mission, Drupal Contractors is proud to announce that we are a Gold Sponsor of Drupal Camp Asheville 2020. It’s our sincere hope that, with the help of events like this, the Drupal community can grow and develop in an inclusive, forward-thinking manner. We invite you to join us as we learn and connect in a laid-back (and productive) environment.

The schedule will be as follows: on Friday, July 10, from 8:30am to 5:00pm, attendees can choose from a variety of training sessions, general contribution sprints, and an ongoing [Unconference](https://www.drupalasheville.com/2020/unconference) that allows for attendee-guided conversations rather than structured presentations. Friday’s full- and half-day training topics include:

* First Time Contributor Workshop
* Getting Started with Drupal 8
* Intermediate to Advanced CSS for Practical Peoples
* Speaker Diversity Workshop

In an effort to keep the spirit of in-person events alive in a time of online-centric virtual meet-ups, Drupal Camp Asheville is hosting a “Not-So-Standard Pizza Party and Social Hour” at 7:30pm on Friday evening.

Saturday, July 11 will be filled with informative sessions, technical tutorials, lightning talks, a prize raffle, and a game night to close the day. The detailed session schedule can be found [here](https://www.drupalasheville.com/schedule). Be sure to check out Chris McGrath and Doug Vann’s business development session! Details below.

### [Freelance: Money grows on trees but the branches are very high!](https://www.drupalasheville.com/2020/session/freelance-money-grows-trees-branches-are-very-high)

1:00p EST | Saturday, July 11, 2020

Join Drupal Contractors’ Chris McGrath and Doug Vann as they lead attendees through the intricacies, obstacles, and little-known facts of freelancing. Topics will include invoicing, time tracking, banking, accounting, taxes, filing your Biz name, and, of course, the best ways in which to get freelance gigs.

### Attending a Virtual Drupal Camp

Drupal Camp Asheville 2020 will be entirely remote this year. The event will be hosted on Hopin, so we’ve included [some resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRBVbUCNTTg) for anyone not familiar with the platform. Individual breakout sessions will take place on Zoom. Attendees will be able to ask questions in the chat, and assigned moderators will pass all questions along to the session. And, as mentioned, there is a concerted effort to maintain the laid back atmosphere we’ve come to know and love, so there will be a pizza party, social hour, and game night to foster community. Any other questions you may have, please reach out to us and we’ll be more than happy to offer assistance.
