Join Esteemed for this year’s three-day Drupal GovCon 2021 virtual conference, held October 13–15, 2021. You can register for the free event [here](https://hopin.com/events/drupal-govcon-2021-66aa9629-a6b6-4f58-8b61-51875a68bf73). We are proud to commit to this event as both a Contributor Sponsor and by having one of our Senior Full Stack Drupal Developers, Rick Torzynski, present a session on machine learning in Drupal.

The schedule will include training, BOFs, opportunities for networking, and a large selection of sessions between 11am–3pm ET on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, October 13–15. The session tracks are as follows:

* Coding and Development
* Community and Being Human
* Content Strategy and Analytics
* Design, UX, and Accessibility
* DevOps, Performance, Security, and Privacy
* Project and Team Management
* Site Building and Using Drupal

While there is a heavy focus on government at GovCon, attendees of Drupal GovCon 2021 can expect to learn about recent improvements to Drupal within the private, non-profit, and education sectors; expand upon their current skill sets; and, given that the event is being broadcast virtually for any and all Drupal enthusiasts to attend, deepen their network within the community.

The conference will be shared through Hopin, an interactive event platform known for providing users with the ability to connect, interact, and engage with others. The full schedule can be found [here](https://www.drupalgovcon.org/2021-schedule).

### Machine Learning in Drupal with Tensorflow.js

In addition to the above features and highlights, Esteemed is proud to announce our very own Rick Torzynski will lead a session entitled, “Machine Learning in Drupal with Tensorflow.js.” The session begins at 2:15pm ET on Wednesday, October 13. In this 45 minute presentation, attendees will learn more about:

* Machine Learning and Deep Learning as a discipline
* How Drupal utilizes ML
* Current ML modules
* The role of Python and Jupyter Notebooks in ML
* How TensorFlow.js improves government agency websites

As part of this Coding and Development track session, Torzynski will demonstrate his newest development, TensorFlow.js, which is an ML-enabled Drupal Component module created to facilitate ML processing directly in Drupal. The Esteemed team hopes to see you there!
