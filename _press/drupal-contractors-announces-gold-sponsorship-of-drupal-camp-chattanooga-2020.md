A full list of approved sessions can be found [here](https://www.drupalcampchattanooga.com/sessions){:target='_blank'}. In addition to our sponsorship of this year’s camp, Drupal Contractors is proud to announce that our very own Matt Obert has been selected to present a tutorial on how to leverage Drupal to comply with global data protection laws.

### [**Drupal Behaviors for Data Protection**](https://www.drupalcampchattanooga.com/sessions/approved/drupal-camp-chattanooga-2020/beginner-track/drupal-behaviors-data-protection)**{:target='_blank'}**

3:00 - 3:50pm | Saturday, November 7

Matt Obert is a creative technologist and Acquia Certified Drupal 8 Site Builder with over twenty years of professional experience. Join him in a breakout informational session on Saturday at 3:00pm where he’ll walk attendees through the complex relationship between web development and data privacy legislation. By attending this session, you will learn about recent legislation such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the latter of which went into effect on January 1 of this year. These laws aim to restrict the ways in which companies (and, therefore, web developers) can track visitors. Obert will explain how to use contributed modules for Drupal 7, 8, and 9 in order to achieve basic compliance with the above regulations. Furthermore, he will show you how to write Drupal Behaviors in a custom module in order to more strictly comply with data privacy and protection measures. This session is a must for those who work with organizations that handle data from Europe and/or California. If you miss it, Obert’s presentation slides can be found [here](https://www.drupalcampchattanooga.com/sites/default/files/slides/2015/Drupal_Behaviors_for_Data_Protection.pdf){:target='_blank'}.

We look forward to connecting with local Drupal enthusiasts at Drupal Camp Chattanooga 2020. Hope to see you there!
