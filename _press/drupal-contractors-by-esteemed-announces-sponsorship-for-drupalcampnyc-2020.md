Drupal Contractors is proud to sponsor DrupalCampNYC 2020, a popular annual developer’s conference serving the New York Drupal community. This event will be held virtually from Thursday, November 12 to Saturday, November 14, 2020. General admission will be free for all attendees this year, as sponsorship funds have covered the cost of tickets.

DrupalCampNYC 2020 is a community-building conference tailored to web developers, graphic designers, Drupal enthusiasts (and newcomers!), project managers, marketing professionals, and anyone interested in open-source CMS. Attendees can expect to network, share knowledge, and collaborate with hundreds of local members of the tri-state area’s Drupal community.

The schedule will be as follows: on Thursday, November 12, DrupalCampNYC 2020 will hold hands-on training sessions. Friday will entail NY-themed Zoom sessions, Birds of a Feather (BoFs) sessions, and opportunities to network and interact with fellow conference attendees. Saturday’s schedule includes both hands-on training and an afternoon of contributing to the Drupal project.

While the event is free, attendees will be charged a $50 deposit for each full-day training session ($25 for half-day training), with the exception of the “Intro to Drupal” session. This is a measure that has been enacted for limited capacity events in an effort to reduce no-shows. These deposits are fully refundable once attendees participate, and those who wish to donate their deposit to our educational non-profit may do so.

### Don’t Miss DrupalCampNYC BoF Sessions

BoF sessions are informal meet-ups of “birds of a feather,” or like-minded individuals. Topics are assigned, though no planned agenda is set. This allows for groups to meet and discuss problems, issues, and shared specific interests in an inclusive environment. Choose from a variety of BoFs [here](https://2020.drupalcamp.nyc/bofs){:target='_blank'}, and be sure to check out these BoFs being led by members of Drupal Contractors:

#### Sharing Your Drupal Freelance/Business Journey

We’ll talk about Drupal careers, starting a freelance business, and how to navigate the world of contract work. Hear from fellow freelancers and contribute your own stories on what works, what doesn’t, and how to improve your freelance efforts.

#### Linux for Developers

3:00 - 3:45p EST | Friday, November 13, 2020

He will lead a BoF discussion on using Linux as a developer’s daily driver.

### Modernizing NYC's radio news using Drupal, AWS, and SalesForce

In addition to the above BoFs, Drupal Contractors is excited to announce that one of our own, Boris Smirnov, will lead a talk on how he helped modernize New York City’s radio news using Drupal, AWS, and SalesForce. Smirnov is a Drupal 7 & 8 Solution Architect with over ten years of experience leading teams and engineering, designing, and developing optimized web applications.
