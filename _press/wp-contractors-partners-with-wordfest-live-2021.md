We’re proud to announce our micro sponsorship of [WordFest Live 2021](https://www.wordfest.live/){:target='_blank'} to start the year off with a global celebration of all things WordPress. WordFest is a 24-hour virtual event that will take place on Friday, January 22, 2021. It is free for all who wish to attend — visit [this link](https://my.wordfest.live/login/){:target='_blank'} to register.

[WP Contractors](https://wpcontractors.com/){:target='_blank'} is a Micro Sponsor of the online gathering, and our sponsorship will go toward supporting the [Big Orange Heart](https://www.bigorangeheart.org/){:target='_blank'} charity, whose mission is to provide mental health and well-being support for remote workers. This cause is very close to our hearts, as WP Contractors is a fully-remote community of freelance professionals. Big Orange Heart reports that with a surge in the number of remote workers, the non-profit has seen an increase in people from the global community “openly acknowledging they are experiencing mental health issues linked to isolation.”

WordFest Live 2021 aims to celebrate the worldwide WordPress community, raise awareness of remote support options, and connect with fellow WordPress enthusiasts in an educational, inclusive environment.

This event will include 48 sessions scheduled over 24 hours to accommodate for time zone differences. Sessions will cover topics that range from hiring remote contract workers and creating a stellar SEO strategy to chair yoga for remote workers. There are WordPress-specific technical tutorials (think: automating WordPress workflows from scratch, and a deep dive into GraphQL API) as well as general sessions designed for freelancers and newly-remote workers. A full list of sessions may be found [here](https://www.wordfest.live/sessions/){:target='_blank'}.

Hear from WordFest Live lead organizer Dan Maby on this 24-hour virtual festival, who says that it “was born out of a need, as with everything from Big Orange Heart; the need for human connection.”

Maby’s fellow organizer Hauwa Abashiya adds, “Playing a part in raising funds to support mental health has given me a sense of fulfillment. What better way to start 2021 than by traveling around the world (virtually still counts) celebrating and learning about WordPress together.”

We couldn’t agree more. The team at WP Contractors, our own members being distributed across the world, will be in attendance — and we hope to see you there!
