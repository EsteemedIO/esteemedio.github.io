This year’s New England Drupal Camp 2022, better known as NEDCamp, will be held in person on Friday, November 18 - 19, 2022, from 9:00am - 5:00pm ET. Esteemed is proud to be the After Party Sponsor for the event to not only further the NEDCamp cause (growing Drupal expertise and community in the New England area) but to ensure that any Drupal enthusiast can network, socialize, and have fun with their peers while learning more about the efforts. 

Back in-person, NEDCamp organizers are excited to offer two days of activities. On November 18th, there will be half-day and full-day trainings, and on November 19th, attendees are welcome to choose from a variety of topics, talks, and BoFs to participate in. Attendees can join the #nedcamp channel on the [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/user/login?destination=join-slack) group for assistance, conversation, and networking.

Highlights of this year’s event will include BoF sessions (exploring topics like Drupal and Gatsby, modern design systems, leading the human workplace, and more), an introductory training course for taking control of your tech career, a keynote speech focused on community contribution by Kaleem Clarkson, COO of Blend Me, Inc, and an afterparty (sponsored by Esteemed!) to end the day.  
  
Check out some of our highlighted sessions below.

### Training: Take Control of Your Tech Career –Focus, Prioritize, and Launch

##### Thursday, November 18, 2021 | 9AM - 4PM ET

With the help of Esteemed leaders, Matt Obert, Dori Kelner, and Stephen Crawford, trainees will learn how to plan their career journey with exercises, short talks, and interactive group and 1-on-1 activities. 

During the session, trainees will set intentions and clarify career goals, all while learning how your brain can actually work against your career success by leaving you fearful, negative, and reactive – in other words – really stressed out. Together, Esteemed and trainees will practice contemplative techniques that will put attendees on the path to success as they learn to develop deep focus, make better decisions, and respond to the unexpected with clarity and perspective.

As we move through the day, these career goals will become the basis for investigating core values, objectives, and tasks. Trainees will build practical skills for prioritization of the tasks so that they can use their time as efficiently as possible.  
  
During the training, attendees will learn how to access their brain’s internal to-do list and walk through multiple methods, frameworks, and tools for task prioritization and scheduling. After the sessions, attendees will walk away with actionable techniques for managing their tasks and accomplishing their goals.

As the day ends, trainees will learn a method of evaluating their Developer Reputation by auditing their public profiles. In the audit, we will collectively look for evidence of:

* Experience (“What you have done”)
* Skills (“What you can do”)
* Community contribution (“What you give back”)

We will take a closer look at several examples in each category, including LinkedIn profiles, portfolio websites, code samples, demo apps, Open Source software projects and code contributions, and the all-important Drupal.org profile. With each example, attendees will gain perspective to help them know whether you have a good one or a bad one (or in some cases, none at all). By the end of this training, attendees will learn to view themselves through the eyes of a hiring manager, and leave with a checklist of action items to improve the way they present themselves online.

### Keynote: The Time is Now — Let’s Get to It

##### Friday, November 19, 2022 | 1:15 - 2:15PM ET

Join Kaleem Clarkson, in his career journey from his first Drupal event to being globally recognized as a remote work expert, as he asks and answers pertinent questions to the Drupal community like: "Why should I participate and contribute to an open source community? How does volunteering my precious time contribute to my personal and professional career path? But, I’m not technical or a digital creative how can I help?"

### Talk: Creating DrupalCode Projects: Drupal ATS by Esteemed

##### Friday, November 19, 2022 | 3:00 - 3:45PM ET

Have you ever wanted to create an official community-contributed Drupal module, but didn't know how to start? Compared to just creating a GitHub repo, DrupalCode projects can seem so intimidating!

In this session, Esteemed Director of Engineering Matt Obert will explain how [Esteemed](https://esteemed.io/) decided to sponsor the Drupal [ATS](https://www.drupal.org/project/ats) project, an open-source Applicant Tracking System built on Drupal, extending the data model of [RedHen CRM](https://www.drupal.org/project/redhen).

In this talk, you'll learn about:

* Code Management: how to take an idea from a Project description, to a `README.md` in a DrupalCode repo, to a development branch, to your first official tagged release
* Code Architecture: when to extend a Class, when to implement an Interface, and when to just use configuration YAML
* Herding Cats: how to motivate developers to contribute to your project, and how to leverage Drupal's Issue Queues for project management

### Talk: How to Lead a Human Workplace

##### Friday, November 19, 2022 | 4:00 - 4:45PM ET

Cutting-edge organizations are turning their focus toward humanizing workplaces and improving the support they offer employees and contractors alike.

When the workplace offers clear purpose, open discussion, and psychological safety, team members will thrive. But what does that mean for the organization? Reduced turnover, greater productivity, enhanced relationships, and overall happier people.

To accomplish this, Dori Kelner, VP of Human Workplace at Esteemed, will examine the root of the organizational culture - leadership. When leaders are authentic, trusting, and open, everyone in the organization will instinctively model the attitude of their leaders. These changes ripple throughout the company, resulting in a happier, more engaged workforce, ready to execute and perform at a higher level.

Come join us to learn how to create both success and happiness in your organization by embracing humanistic leadership.

Attendees of this session will walk away with:

* An understanding of the human workplace and how it benefits your organization
* Valuing the importance of your team members’ unique perspectives and needs
* How changing your habitual patterns of thinking will build greater connectedness, resilience, and kindness
