We can help you find a fractional Agile Coach for your projects, and help       improve your efficiency by 200-300 percent.

To prevent setbacks and road blocks during this transition, our Agile coaches can work with executives        or team members from different departments in your company.

Not only is Agile adoption now considered a mainstream business        practice, but it has an impressive impact.                                                             When Should You Turn to Agile Coaching?:     If your team feels as if its daily Scrum isn’t as effective as it could be, our Agile     facilitators can coach your employees directly, and in detail. Alternatively, if management isn’t yet     convinced of the new method’s potential, an Agile coach can offer executive leadership counseling. By removing     any top-level resistance, we can help align expectations and improve organizational transparency.         As with any project, collaboration is central to a favorable outcome. Your coach will     facilitate communication and foster collaboration between your teams and business units. To prevent failed     projects and incomplete implementation, hire an Agile coach to assist with the transition.     With Esteemed, you will be matched with the perfect Agile coach who will guide you through     the cross-departmental adoption process and educate your team(s) along the way. In working with an Agile     coach, you will set your business up for a successful adoption of Agile processes.

In essence, you’re planning. During discovery, you’ll learn about     what you do and do not have and whether this assists in (or prevents you from) completing the project.      What do discovery and planning entail?:     Planning your project’s strategy isn’t as simple as it sounds. Brainstorming sessions are a     useful tool in your discovery and planning stage, but without proper direction, your team risks hyper-fixating     on a single element of your project’s scope or, conversely, taking on an overly-ambitious vision. In striking     a balance between your wants and needs, and by adjusting the lens with which you view the extent of your     project, you’ll create a strong foundation to build upon.     Discovery and planning offer insights and enable your team to set expectations. It’s a     strategic step used by top organizations from a project’s outset to bring stakeholders together to improve     communication and transparency. We’ll speak with all collaborators to glean expectations and research the     current state of business. Your consultant will guide your team through the research process, defining KPIs,     requirements, and potential pain points.     Discovery and planning involves a qualitative and quantitative approach to develop your     project’s optimal strategy. When finished, your team will have a project roadmap that will lead you to your     end goal(s).

Businesses rely on up-to-date tech to        remain competitive and perform essential functions. It’s critical to have a dedicated executive to evaluate, implement, and manage relevant technology to serve your business        needs.

Companies that work with Fractional CTOs often do so contractually, temporarily, or at        reduced hours.                       Schedule a Call                                                                        Hire a Chief Technology Officer For a Fraction of the Cost:                                                       For businesses looking to cut costs or compartmentalize technological management, a Fractional CTO     offers the benefits of a full-time CTO — for a fraction of the cost.     Unlike full-time CTOs, a Fractional CTO typically concentrates their efforts in     predetermined areas. Rather than take on the broad responsibilities of their full-time counterparts,     Fractional CTOs have specialized tasks. A start-up, for example, might hire a Fractional CTO to develop its     technology roadmap and initial strategy. Companies launching new products or services are known to bring in     Fractional CTOs long enough for them to see the project through. As organizations navigate a sudden shift to     remote work, Fractional CTOs are useful resources to address the technological needs and necessary     implementation requirements.     We have a team of pre-vetted, top-tier, professional Fractional CTOs with industry-specific     knowledge and skill sets. When you work with Esteemed Talent, you’ll receive a curated list of expert CTOs     available for immediate hire. This arrangement is cost-effective and improves your time and resource     efficiency. With our Fractional CTO service, you’ll waste no time on tedious recruiting and onboarding. Our     team members are capable of quickly addressing your needs and getting up to speed on important projects.

A fractional CTO is defined as a CTO who manages technology for a company “for a fraction of the time, on a fraction of the projects, and for a fraction of the cost,” compared to their traditional full-time counterpart. There’s no distinction between education level, years of experience, or any other skill – the only difference is that a fractional CTO is essentially an on-demand consultant for specific projects, plans, or technologies.               What does a Fractional CTO do?         There are a host of functions and responsibilities that a fractional CTO takes on, and they generally vary by the company’s industry, size, and maturity. Fractional CTOs typically involve themselves in both the technical aspect (collaborating with developers, overseeing IT maintenance, etc. ) and with business development. Sometimes, a fractional CTO will focus exclusively on technology matters. These executives are actively involved in decision-making and play a critical role in connecting upper management with tech teams.               Why should I hire a Fractional CTO?         Fractional CTOs are added to a company’s upper management when the organization faces challenges with an existing development team. A fractional CTO is a great solution if you require a talented individual to fill the role, but either don’t have the resources to bring on a full-time hire or your business is still growing and doesn’t yet provide enough work for a full-time CTO. With a fractional CTO, you can address precisely the projects you’re prepared to tackle, and you’re getting a seasoned professional with diverse experience (and a fresh perspective!) at a fraction of the cost.               How do I hire a Fractional CTO?         Hiring a fractional CTO comes with its own set of challenges. If you’re looking to hire a fractional CTO, you’re most likely seeking a hiring solution that provides immediate benefits at a fraction of the time and money it would cost to follow the more “traditional” route. At Esteemed, we’ve cultivated a community of fractional CTOs who are available, on-demand, to help your business scale. When you team up with us, you gain immediate access to a team of pre-screened, highly-skilled fractional CTOs. We help startups and established organizations alike find top talent who are ready for immediate hire.                Does my business really need a Fractional CTO?         Fractional CTOs can help your organization by taking on any responsibility you would otherwise ask of a full-time CTO. They’ll design and execute your technology strategies, manage your IT team, serve on executive committees, and present reports. They’ll also make critical business decisions – backed by CTO industry trends and time-honored methods. Fractional CTOs get greater exposure to more organizations, more teams, more talent, and more projects than if they remained at a single company for the entirety of their career. Your business benefits from this, and by teaming up with a fractional CTO, you’re positioning your organization to adapt to emerging technologies.

If you bring in a new client for us, any other lead that generates from the same hiring manager will pay out as well.      If a 10% lead is closed, you would collect the 5% on each subsequent job they do. If you continue developing the account and bringing more leads, those would continue at 10%.     *This program would be compiled and paid out monthly, in addition to any other compensation you may receive from Esteemed.      It will pay 1 month trailing, meaning the bonus generated for the billing month of January would be paid in February, and so forth.     *Bonuses would continue at 100% payout for the first 12 months of each lead, and then at 50% for the following 6 months, before dropping off entirely at the 18 month mark.

Esteemed evolved from conversations with designers, developers, and other remote workers in the Drupal community and beyond.       Chris McGrath founded Esteemed after creating one of the largest Drupal talent networks, DrupalContractors. Together with a team of ambitious go-getters, he's built a talent experience platform for digital independents around the world.                                           &lt;/section&gt;          Our values                           Results:       Work can be challenging.

Our process helps you find the right candidates, further your relationships with clients, and complete your projects with trusted resources.                       Which programming languages and disciplines do we screen?             With Esteemed Screening, we cover all major programming languages, like HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, React, . NET, and C#. Additionally, we cover CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, and Magento. Need a different language or discipline? We can help with that. Contact us at screening@esteemed. io                       How are candidates screened for technical skills?             After understanding your business needs and potential candidates, we review their portfolios, code samples, and styles of communication. Based on their level of expertise, we then provide assessments or coding challenges to each candidate. If they succeed with the assessment, they move onto an elective technical interview, where we can discuss specific requirements for the job you’re hiring for.                       Does Esteemed Screening really use “real humans”?             Yes! All of our candidates are screened in-house, by developers with real-world experience. Every technical interview, coding assessment, and portfolio is reviewed by our team.                       Do I really receive “unlimited screening”?             Yes! This is meant to provide the most value for you and your candidates. Our flat subscription rate is $699 a year, or you can leverage your own assessments for $399, and supplement with technical interviews as needed.                      "

            "title": "8 Biggest Challenges Tech Recruiters Face in 2023",
            "thumbnail": "/uploads/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-5439375.jpg",
            "body": "2023/04/05 - In 2023, tech recruiters are watching their competitors snatch top talent. They also compete with job seekers’ shifting priorities. These priorities are encouraging digital leaders to become more proactive. They are aligning their people strategy with their business strategy, expanding their talent pool, and making new efforts to understand employees’ wants. Yet, they are also weighing economic factors. While tech recruiters realize the demand for tech solutions and products will persevere, they are still dealing with persistent hiring challenges from the previous year and an abundance of new ones. 1. Evaluating Skills: Tech leaders need a highly skilled workforce to keep up with the pace of change within the digital environment. The World Economic Forum reports that technological advancements will radically transform numerous jobs. Globalization and COVID-19-related industry shifts will also make an impact. The international organization warned that core skills for many jobs would change in 2022, and if trends like this continue, outdated education will worsen the skills mismatch. Currently, employers are taking steps to align their workforce with their business objectives. They are identifying their company’s critical skills and assessing skill needs to expand and retain talent. This clarity can help them determine gaps, overlaps, training, and pathways to progression so employees can quickly and easily transition to high-skilled roles. As a result, they are reskilling and upskilling their employees. In addition, they are having recruiters focus less on degrees and more on skills during the hiring process. 2. Employee Retention: Employers are still finding ways to mitigate the impact of the Great Resignation and quiet quitting. Workers are still leaving their jobs at a steady rate due to an unpleasant work environment or burnout. And, if they aren’t quitting, they are doing their work at the bare minimum. This type of low engagement costs the world economy $7. 8 billion, according to Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report. Employers are responding using an old method but with a new name, “quiet hiring,” which means tech recruiters don’t have to look outside the company for promising talent. Instead, they are helping to fill jobs internally. They identify workers doing their regular job and taking on additional tasks related to a vacant position. Ultimately, the employee gets promoted, and the employer saves money on hiring and training costs. Tech recruiters can ask more questions about a job candidate’s motivations and career goals during the hiring process to help improve employee retention. They can also gather actionable feedback from current employees, such as employee satisfaction surveys. 3. Economic Uncertainty: Business executives are attempting to navigate an uncertain economic environment. Members of the National Association for Business Economics participating in a January 2023 survey gauged the likelihood of a recession at more than 50 percent. The volatility has produced predictions ranging from a recession to robust growth. Despite persistent high inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, and rising commodity and energy prices, the economy has experienced substantial gains. For example, consumer spending started the year off strong. Some tech companies are slowing the pace of hiring and moving around resources in response to the uncertainty and hoping to stay resilient. A survey of CFOS, C-Suite executives, and managers that CFO. com shared revealed that nearly all of the respondents planned to make budget cuts. Three out of five anticipated reducing costs associated with hiring and retaining talent despite critical first-quarter hiring needs. Business managers are considering cost-effective learning strategies, such as mentorships, to position workers so they are adequate for present needs and well-positioned for future roles. Tech recruiters can continue to hire the best talent with the best skills. Some are doing this by changing their hiring approach and hiring contractors. 4. Diversity and Inclusion: Diversity and inclusion remain a priority for new hires. More than a third of participants responding to a McKinsey Global Survey revealed that they didn’t pursue a job because they believed the organization lacked an inclusive workplace. They also wanted to see employers advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Some suggestions they shared included holding conversations recognizing the need for inclusion, taking action that improves efforts and behaviors, and setting goals for underrepresented groups in recruitment, succession planning, and sponsorship programs. More management teams are taking note. In 2020, companies worldwide spent an estimated $7. 5 billion on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which is projected to double by 2026, according to the Global Parity Alliance. However, the cross-industry group committed to advancing DEI also noticed that the pace could be faster even though progress is occurring. So, it launched the DEI Lighthouse Programme to promote DEI initiatives. It is an annual effort to find and equip leaders with DEI best practices. 5. Right Technology Tools: Rapid technological transformations may leave several business leaders wondering whether their tech tools are enough. Advanced technologies can support new strategies, practices, and innovation from new hires. However, inadequate tech tools pave the way for cybersecurity risks and compliance issues and limit the company’s competitive advantage. As these leaders analyze business issues and process improvements, some realize that their disparate systems limit their strategic responses and business updates. The massive technological changes are also creating shifts within industries that are helping to expand and accelerate a business’ capabilities and processes. These changes support remote hiring, workflows, upskilling opportunities, and skills assessments. Employers can consider conducting an IT audit to assess the effectiveness of current technology tools and their ability to minimize business risks. They can also establish the business’s requirements criteria to help make informed purchasing decisions. 6. Remote Work: Employers still have difficulty getting workers to return to the office despite a tight labor market. However, workers are now more accustomed to having a flexible work schedule. This change has eased their work-life balance and supported their mental well-being. As a result, they have made remote work options a top priority in their job search. Remote work is here and will likely stay since it offers numerous employee and employer benefits. For instance, Companies shore up overhead costs and see improved performance. A 2022 survey conducted by The Harris Poll for Express Employment Professionals found that three in five businesses found that remote work positively impacted the company and didn’t harm their efforts. In addition, business leaders see more engagement and job satisfaction. Tech recruiters will need to pay attention to how job candidates discuss their work style during the hiring process and take note of flexible work preferences, which will allow them to sweeten the deal when making a job offer. 7. Compensation and Benefits Package: Workers emphasize when, where, and how they work during the hiring process. As a result, employers are finding that it’s critical to demonstrate the value of the employee with their compensation and benefits package. It supports not only recruitment but retention. The package enables recruiters the agility to meet workers’ needs. If they cannot meet one factor like a high wage, they can compensate with another incentive, such as more paid time off. Some companies are letting employees determine their pay package, for instance, choosing cash and stock options. However, employers can revisit and refresh their benefits on an ongoing basis and help employees maximize their use when they make significant changes due to life events, such as marriage or childbirth. 8. Competition Outside of the Tech Sector: According to a Handshake Network Trends report, recent college graduates are anxious yet optimistic about their job prospects. The respondents, mostly business and tech majors, sought stability and salary as their top priorities. In addition, members of the class of 2023 applied for jobs sooner. They also kept an eye on Big Tech layoffs. Many graduates expanded their job search to reach other industries and sectors. Recruiters welcome them by looking past the student’s major or school and more at underlying transferable skills that match specific business needs. The recent tech company layoffs, hiring freezes, and downscaled recruiting efforts have flooded the job market with tech talent, and companies in industries needing their digital skills, such as healthcare, are set to benefit. Some are scooping up top tech talent to help modernize business functions and processes and harness data to improve their services. Tech workers also see advantages; they can broaden their expertise and skill set by solving new types of problems. Some tech recruiters pick up new talent and shape new ones by not requiring a four-year college degree. It’s a result of many tech companies’ efforts to fast-pace the hiring process and erase the supply-demand imbalance. Some have added apprenticeship programs and have partnered with community colleges. After a series of economic, social, and political shifts, business leaders understand the need to stay agile. As a result, they are skirting labor issues with strategies to enhance talent sourcing and placing and placing more focus on aspects like culture, compensation, and work-life balance. Likewise, tech recruiters are navigating the talent acquisition challenges and heeding the people-first effort to produce an efficient hiring process that yields results. "

            "body": "2023/03/13 - Opportunities to work from home have ballooned over the past few years, and technological advancements are making the arrangements more attainable for workers and employers. While remote work is still evolving, it’s creating alterations in work options and styles in relation to occupation and geography. Workers are enjoying more freedom and taking control of their work life. Employers are able to reduce their expenses and expand their talent reach and talent pool. They are also becoming more proactive about supporting their workers’ well-being. In addition, remote work is tossing out some traditional job boundaries. These changes are giving employers the chance to experiment with new approaches in the digital workplace. Their efforts and new innovations are ultimately making working from home a permanent change. Here are ten benefits and best practices of remote work. 1. Flexible Work Options: Job candidates have placed workplace flexibility among their top priorities, according to the 2022 Global Talent Trends report released by LinkedIn. Working from home makes it easier for workers to tackle errands and find time to attend events. Employers that let workers create their own schedules allow them to visit the doctor, take care of their vehicle and household repairs, attend their child’s school event, or manage childcare without worrying that their time away from work could negatively impact their job. The flexibility enables workers to work from home, pack their laptops, and venture elsewhere. For example, they may work at a relative’s or vacation home to avoid cramped settings and noisy neighbors. Or, they may become “digital nomads” and align their work schedules with their personal travel itinerary. However, employers also get some perks too. They can snag competitive talent and keep their top performers longer with flexible work options. Flexible arrangements allow them to expand their search for new employees. In addition, they can diversify their workforce to accelerate innovation. When setting up flexible work options, discussing expectations and boundaries for work hours and communication is essential. Sometimes, a worker may need to stagger their hours to avoid distractions in the home, such as children or a spouse on a call. In addition, consider setting up regular check-ins to help keep the work on track and communication flowing. 2. Boosted Productivity: Chatty coworkers, personal phone conversations from a coworker in the next cubicle, ringing phones, chimes from alerts and notifications, and copy machines or printers are among the distractions that occur in the workplace. Remote work avoids those issues and lets workers create a more productive work environment at home because they can find the time and place that will help maximize their output. Workers with a fully flexible schedule showed 29 percent higher productivity compared to those who couldn’t adjust to their shift, according to the 2022 Future Forum Pulse survey. The survey questioned more than 10,000 workers throughout the world. It also found that half of the fully remote respondents were able to improve their focus. Remote work gives workers more work-life balance, which can help them pace their work, so they produce consistent, high-quality results and avoid burnout. In addition, workers can organize unique workstyles that help them address their assignments at peak performance time and care for their family and physical and emotional health. Employers can discover and experiment with productivity tools to determine what works for their teams. They can also motivate workers with recognition and rewards, offer support for professional development and help workers set goals to drive better performance. Workers can boost their productivity by learning the hours throughout the day when they have the most energy and the least distractions. This assessment will also help them determine how they schedule their tasks and choose when to tackle their most cognitively demanding ones. 3. Reduced Stress Levels: Workers can bypass the congestion of inner city transport systems and other traffic-clogged roads when they work from home. They also cut out long commutes and crowded transit stations. As a result, they avoid stressful situations and can reallocate their time to support a healthier work-life balance. At home, workers gain more control over how they do their work and design settings conducive to productivity and relaxation. For example, they can create or seek out quieter and more comfortable environments. In addition, remote workers may enjoy some reprieve from the unpleasant aspects of the company culture, such as gossip and cliques, helping them to focus more on their job. A Mental Health America study of 17,000 workers found that negative work environments can contribute to higher rates of absenteeism, conflict in personal relationships, and unhealthy behaviors like alcohol or substance abuse. While workers can not avoid all workplace stressors, working from home can give them more flexibility and control regarding how to deal with them. Remote workers can structure their day to limit distractions. For example, they can create a routine that includes regular breaks, exercise, and lunch times. Workers can also schedule their social interactions in a way that lets them maintain and make new connections. As workers’ stress levels subside, employers reap the benefits. The workers become more engaged and satisfied with their job, which enhances the company’s culture and productivity. 4. Cost Savings: Employers can achieve more cost savings with remote workers. They can circumvent costs like office supplies and equipment, utility fees, janitorial services, security, parking spaces, and rental fees. In addition, remote work is becoming a valuable bargaining chip for employers looking for ways to retain employees without increasing pay. Employers can also save money on turnover because of job satisfaction. The research firm Global Workplace Analytics found that telework can save companies $500 billion a year. The reduced costs resulted from real estate, electricity, absenteeism, turnover, and productivity. Ultimately, businesses can pocket more than $11,000 per employee per year, and this savings is if employees worked only half of the time from home. Workers realize cost savings as they either reduce or eliminate their gas, vehicle maintenance and insurance, wardrobe fees, and childcare costs. Staying at home avoids those quick stopovers to get coffee and expensive lunch meals at the cafeteria or with coworkers. Global Workplace Analytics has estimated that employees working at home half the time can save between $600 and $6,000 per year. Workers can start conserving their money by stocking up on nutritious foods and storing ready-to-heat-leftovers to avoid the temptation of getting unhealthy takeout meals. Coffee lovers should invest in setting up their coffee station to avoid runs to the coffee shop. Workers can also monitor work-related expenses they can claim as home office deductions. 5. Improved Work-Life Management: Working from home can make it easier to manage the day, especially for parents and caregivers who can focus on strengthening their relationships with their loved ones. Since they gain time from not having a daily work commute, workers can get up later and put away a pile of laundry or dishes in between virtual meetings. They can carve out the time to go to routine medical appointments or attend an event at their child’s school without worrying about jeopardizing their job. They can show up and be more present in their personal relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic created at-home work environments where spouses or partners worked side by side, and parents set up digital classrooms for their kids nearby to help monitor their progress. Volunteerism is one way employers can encourage social interaction and social action. They can also suggest workers focus on making their time more productive rather than putting in additional hours and checking in their workload. Fitness stipends, different options for childcare support, and mental health support are some perks companies can add. Workers can effectively reach their work-life management goals by establishing routines and work schedules with a clear start and end time. They can ensure their work area is separate from living spaces in their home to avoid the temptation to check their email. They can also invest in ergonomic desk furniture. Most importantly, taking breaks for walks and letting their eyes rest can help them maintain a healthy lifestyle. 6. Increased degree of autonomy: Remote workers can choose how they want to go about their day and perform their tasks with less oversight. They don’t have to worry about someone peeking over their shoulder at their screen and micromanagers continuously stopping by their cubicle or holding impromptu meetings to get a pulse on their work activities. Instead, workers can find a work rhythm that lets them function effectively and take breaks to refresh and develop new ideas. As a result, autonomy can boost work performance because it empowers workers to grow, trust their skills and capabilities, and make confident decisions. It can also help reduce stress and lead to better job satisfaction. Giving workers autonomy fosters greater responsibility, engagement, creativity, and motivation. For employers, these attributes can result in more productive teams and a successful organization. Employers can promote autonomy by encouraging their workers to attend workshops and invest in training and skill development to empower their ability to work responsibly and independently. They can also establish boundaries via project management and audio or visual check-ins. 7. More Collaborative Culture: Remote work requires finding alternative communication methods since many social cues are missing, such as body language and vocal tone. These cues are necessary to ensure the normal pace and structure of conversations. Video conferencing and team collaboration technologies, like Zoom and Teams, and project management programs became essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and have helped support teamwork and team-building activities. Many of these technologies have mobile apps that can keep workers connected, especially when running errands or waiting for appointments. For instance, workers can easily hop from their laptops to their smartphones. Video conferencing technologies increase engagement because people see their coworkers all at once on the screen, and they receive content at the same time. Both employers and employees can create virtual team-building rituals, such as celebrations and socializing events, to strengthen work relationships. They should also ensure their messages are clear to avoid misinterpretation, even if it means writing a longer email. 8. Lessened Environmental Impact: The benefits of workers doing their job from home can support them, their employers, and the overall global efforts to protect the environment. In 2019, the U. S. Census Bureau reported that the average one-way work commute in the U. S. was 27. 6 minutes. Remote work helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing cars on the road and traffic congestion, which can lead to a buildup of pollutants. Employers can conserve energy and reduce waste, helping to curb their carbon footprint within the office space. Since companies can cut costs, they can reallocate their budgets. Employers maintaining office space can use natural lights, reduce heating and increase cooling temperatures, clean filters, and check for eligible tax breaks. Workers can consider clean energy sources to help reduce expenses, such as installing solar panels. Meanwhile, simple actions like turning off their computer or putting it into sleep mode and not ordering takeout can help reduce waste and their carbon footprint, especially since some food establishments may use plastic for packaging their food. 9. A More Accessible and Inclusive Workplace: Remote work creates more job opportunities for people living with disabilities. They can avoid barriers and obstacles in office settings and during their daily commute. Remote work has helped individuals with compromised immune systems reduce their exposure to illnesses like COVID-19, RSV, and the flu. It also helps people suffering from specific mental issues like anxiety because it can limit social interactions and noisy distractions, such as random chimes and computer ping notifications. In addition, working from home allows workers with disabilities to customize their environments to meet their personalized needs and take advantage of the flexibility to schedule appointments. Let’s face it. Events come up in life that can change circumstances. For example, a car accident may have landed a worker in the hospital, or they may have to take time to care for a loved one. Remote work helps employers retain employees when unforeseen or unfortunate events arise. It also diversifies the talent pool creating more diversity of thought. Employers can create open and honest communication by empathizing and asking what accommodations are needed for their workers. For example, they can clearly communicate which deadlines are flexible and which are not. Employers can also support workers with disabilities by providing a stipend to help set up their environment for specific equipment and promoting wellness programs that can focus on meditation, breathwork, and self-care remedies. Accommodating overlooked and underrepresented communities can encourage more productivity and job satisfaction, which can produce more results. 10. Higher Job Satisfaction: Working from home can provide an instant boost in job satisfaction. Workers don’t have to power through their day in the confines of their office. Instead, they can take more productive breaks that include exercise and meditation. According to the annual ADPRI “People at Work 2022: A Global Workforce View” survey, 89 percent of respondents working from home expressed more optimism about the next five years compared to peers who had to report to the office. Nearly half of them indicated that it made it easier to parent. The survey questioned 32,000 workers from 17 countries. Two-thirds of the participants indicated that they would consider looking for a new job if required to return to the office full-time. Employers can help maintain job satisfaction through acknowledgment and recognition programs. They can also show appreciation for activities like taking on additional projects through praise in newsletters and other internal communication channels like Slack. In addition, employers can send out short surveys to get feedback about the work environment to learn what’s working well and what needs improvement. Remote work can be a win-win for workers and employers as long as they set clear standards and expectations. Workers need to choose a productive work area with limited distractions, set a schedule and establish a routine that allows them to take breaks to eat, exercise, socialize with colleagues, and recharge. Employers must evaluate the job roles workers can do partly from home and which ones the workers can do fully remote. Then, they should adapt to workers’ needs by making available resources that support their productivity and mental health. They should also request feedback more frequently to help improve work experiences and create policies that support optimal performance. Employers must also keep an eye on the technological and workplace trends that support remote work. "

            "body": "2023/02/15 - At the start of 2023, headlines shifted from the Great Resignation to layoffs. However, job seekers are likely to maintain more power than they think, as the labor market remains strong and demand for tech employment remains high. Despite the layoff surge from Big Tech such as Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Meta, and Salesforce, they only represent a portion of the tech industry. Many opportunities still exist, particularly for all small to medium-sized tech companies needing tech expertise. Meanwhile, workers have continued to leave their jobs to look for companies that align more with flexible lifestyles and provide a greater sense of purpose, well-being, and skills growth. With a strong job market and the ongoing shift to appease workers’ desires for flexible, remote, and hybrid workplaces, leaders are still undertaking the best ways to manage their workforce. Here are some of the ongoing trends for 2023 that companies are focused on to attract A-list employees and leverage top-performing freelancers in the modern workplace. 1. Well-being Remains a Top Priority for Employee Retention: Mental, physical, and sound financial health are the main drivers for employee retention. Top priorities for 2023 include human leadership training to support a human workplace. According to a recent Gartner Report, “This is a priority for 60% of HR leaders, and 24% say their leadership development approach does not prepare leaders for the future of work”. What makes up human leadership? Gartner Research has identified the following:  Authentic: Act with purpose and enable true self-expression for themselves and their teams.  Empathetic: Show genuine care, respect, and concern for employees’ well-being.  Adaptive: Enable flexibility and support that fits team members’ unique needs. While these qualities have always been important, top performers consider the above leadership components vital to their work contribution and engagement. Organizations with more human leaders will have higher engagement and less turnover. Employees show higher engagement rates when reporting to human leaders versus employees who don’t consider their leadership to be practicing human leadership qualities. Highly engaged employees improve team performance by up to 27%, leading to more revenue and higher profitability. 2. Employers Continue to Focus on Remote and Hybrid Work: The trend for creating human workplaces with remote and hybrid work options remains strong, even though some companies demand their employees return to the office full-time. Many organizations know that pressing their workforce to return to the office will exacerbate turnover rates. According to Gallup, more than half of Americans can work remotely, and up to 60% want a long-term hybrid option. Employers are focusing on making their organizations more adaptable to the fluid-changing business conditions. Gallup also noted that nearly one-third of employees would more than likely look for work elsewhere if their employer didn’t offer an option to work remotely. Companies are listening, and several organizations are planning to design a workforce that reflects a combination of workplace options, such as:  55% fully hybrid workers 22% fully remote workers 23% fully on-site workersFlexible, hybrid, and remote work models give employees more opportunities to strike a work-life balance. They have more time to manage their lives between family, friends, and physical and social activities that support overall well-being. The time savings on commutes and gas, parking, and public transportation costs during sharp increases in inflation give workers a chance to save money. 3. DEI Continues to Drive Talent Acquisition and Retention: Companies with Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives aim to produce more equitable outcomes. They address systematic inequality and ensure fair treatment and opportunities for all employees attracting and retaining the best and the brightest. A diverse and inclusive workplace attracts a broader pool of candidates in a tight employment market where a highly skilled workforce is in high demand. Companies promoting positive and inclusive human workplaces where all employees feel valued, respected, and heard will attract and retain top performers. Employees are more likely to stay with a company that values and respects them. When employees feel included and valued, they’re more likely to be engaged and satisfied with their work, improving morale and performance. McKinsey &amp; Company’s 2020 Diversity Wins report underlines DEI as a significant driver for better business results and financial performance over time. Diverse companies provide a more comprehensive range of perspectives, which leads to more effective decision-making. Diversity helps companies find solutions to problems that might otherwise go unsolved if they had been tasked with a group of people who think alike. Effective decisions lead to efficient processes and innovative solutions, boosting creativity and productivity. Companies focusing on DEI best practices also provide better customer service because they accurately reflect a diverse population driving brand loyalty. A Deloitte study found that 57% of consumers are more loyal to brands that commit to addressing social inequities in their actions. Consequently, companies with strong DEI practices improve a company’s reputation. They create more positive and productive work environments while positioning themselves as industry leaders. As a result, DEI-leading companies reduce turnover, increase engagement and drive revenue. 4. Purpose-Driven Employers Remain a Top Talent Choice: In 2023 purpose-driven employers are better positioned to attract top talent and younger Gen Z workers in a tight employment market. As more and more employees want to have a purpose within their work. Purpose-driven employers also provide more significant opportunities for growth. According to Deloitte, “Purpose-driven companies witness higher market share gains and grow three times faster on average than their competitors, all while achieving higher workforce and customer satisfaction. ” They’re often mission-driven and give their employees opportunities to develop new skills and take on new challenges helping them grow personally and professionally. So it’s not surprising that organizations are looking for ways to align their purpose with their employees’ personal and professional aspirations. They understand that their employees are a source of growth. Studies from Gallup show that employees who feel a strong sense of purpose and connection to their employer are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and productive, leading to company hire earnings. The Gallup study also shows that high employee engagement boosts retention. Low-engagement teams typically endure turnover rates that are 18% to 43% higher than highly engaged teams. Employees are less likely to look for other work during economic uncertainty. 5. Employees Still Want Upskilling and Reskilling Opportunities: In the rapidly changing job market, upskilling and reskilling are increasingly important for employers to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. Many companies are investing in their employees by providing opportunities to develop new skills and enhance their existing ones. One way employers provide upskilling and reskilling is through training programs and workshops. These programs cover a wide range of topics, from new technologies to soft skills like leadership and teamwork. Employers are also investing in employees through online learning platforms offering various courses and certifications. The following are examples of companies that have implemented successful upskilling and reskilling programs. IBM has a comprehensive reskilling program it launched to provide 30 million people with new skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow by 2030. The program offers employees access to thousands of online courses and certifications. This program has helped IBM stay ahead of the technological curve and allowed its employees to develop their skills continually.  Amazon provides a variety of training and development programs for its employees, including its “Career Choice” program, which pays for employees to take courses in fields that are in high demand. This program has helped Amazon attract and retain skilled employees, which has resulted in improved productivity and job satisfaction.  Accenture’s “Skills to Succeed” program focuses on helping employees develop the skills they need to succeed in the digital economy. This program includes online courses, certifications, and hands-on projects that allow employees to gain practical experience. As a result of the program, Accenture has been able to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. These programs have helped companies attract and retain a highly skilled workforce, leading to increased productivity and improved job satisfaction. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives help employees grow professionally and help companies stay competitive in the job market. Employers who invest in their employees will reap the rewards of increased productivity, improved job satisfaction, and a stronger, more skilled workforce 6. Employers are Leveraging Data-Driven Recruitment: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes how organizations recruit and hire new talent. In the past, the recruitment process was largely manual and relied heavily on intuition and guesswork. But with the advent of AI, organizations can now leverage data-driven insights to make more informed and objective hiring decisions. The[ AI market expects to expand to US$1,597 billion by 2030](https://www. precedenceresearch. com/artificial-intelligence-market#:~:text=The%20global%20artificial%20intelligence%20(AI,USD%20147. 58%20billion%20in%202021. ). AI accesses data-driven recruitment through the use of machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns and correlations that would be difficult for humans to detect. For example, an AI-powered recruitment platform can analyze resumes, job descriptions, and candidate performance data to identify the essential skills and qualifications for a particular role. This information can create targeted recruitment campaigns, streamline the application review process, and determine the best candidates. Another way AI leverages data-driven recruitment is by automating specific tasks that recruiters and hiring managers perform. For instance, an AI-powered platform can automatically screen resumes and applications, eliminating the need for manual review. It can also automate the scheduling of interviews and provide real-time feedback to candidates, saving the recruiter’s time and effort. It also helps to reduce bias and ensure a more objective and fair selection process. AI can also personalize the recruitment experience for both candidates and recruiters. For example, AI-powered platforms can suggest job openings matching a candidate’s skills and knowledge, reducing their time to search for the proper role. Finally, AI can investigate the performance of a company’s recruitment efforts and identify areas for improvement. For instance, an AI-powered platform can analyze the time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, and candidate experience metrics, providing recruiters with actionable insights to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their recruitment process. Ultimately, AI makes the entire recruitment process more efficient and convenient. It helps organizations to make more informed and objective hiring decisions, improving the candidate experience and finding the best talent for an organization. 7. Demand for Freelancers Grows: Freelancing is a growing trend. In 2023 up to 78% of companies are expected to hire freelancers versus adding staff. Companies rely on more contract and freelance workers to meet short-term business needs. Freelancers offer businesses access to a broader pool of talent and expertise, which is becoming increasingly important in a fast-changing job market. Companies working with freelancers can quickly and easily bring in specific skills and experience as needed without having to invest in full-time employees. Many companies have found that freelancers are a flexible and cost-effective solution for filling skills gaps, particularly during economic uncertainty. Hiring freelancers is a way to reduce costs and manage workforce expenses more effectively. Overall, the need for businesses to stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions drives the demand for freelancers. Companies leveraging the benefits of freelancers can adapt to changing market conditions and meet the challenges of the latest job market. 8. Talent Experience Platform Adoption Continues: The adoption of Talent Experience Platforms (TXP) continues to impact the hiring landscape in 2023. TXPs are becoming increasingly popular as organizations look for ways to improve the candidate experience and streamline recruitment processes. TXP solutions provide HR organizations with a centralized platform to bring all the tools and processes needed to manage talent acquisition. From job postings and candidate sourcing to interviewing and offer management. TXPs encompasses content, learning, and analytics, driving employee unity and engagement with the following benefits:  Improved candidate experience: TXP solution provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience for candidates.  Increased efficiency: Saving HR organizations time and reducing errors, TXP solutions automate many of the manual tasks involved in recruitment.  Better data and analytics: With all the recruitment data in one place, TXP solutions provide HR organizations with powerful insights into their talent acquisition processes, which helps inform decision-making and drive continuous improvement.  Improved collaboration: TXP solutions bring together stakeholders for the recruitment process. Fostering cooperation between HR, hiring managers, and associated teams, resulting in better communication and engaging outcomes. Ultimately the adoption of TXPs is changing the hiring landscape providing HR organizations with the tools and processes they need to improve the candidate experience, increase efficiency, and provide better data and analytics. 9. Alumni Networks Continue to Make an Impact: In 2023, corporate alumni networks will be seen as a valuable alternative tool for HR organizations. They’re a way for companies to leverage former employees for recruitment. Alumni networks can help maintain seasoned relationships with employees and tap into their expertise and personal networks. They aim to keep former employees connected with their previous employees, providing an opportunity to attract experienced professionals back to the organization. These networks can benefit companies looking to fill a skills gap or seek experienced talent. Internal HR departments are finding alumni platforms and networks to be effective because they:  Foster brand loyalty: Alumni networks help to build brand loyalty and maintain positive relationships with key talent.  Create a talent pipeline: They provide a pool of talented individuals HR organizations can tap into when they need to fill a position.  Promote mentorship and career development: Connecting former employees with current employees can help promote mentorship and career development, leading to better retention and stronger employee engagement.  Enhance brand reputation: Companies with solid alumni networks are often seen as having a positive workplace culture and a commitment to employee development, ultimately enhancing a company’s reputation and attracting top talent. Overall, corporate alumni networks are helping organizations attract top talent and improve their hiring outcomes. 10. Salary Transparency Gains More Traction: Salary transparency is becoming increasingly important in the hiring process for 2023 moving towards more open and honest compensation practices. Many organizations recognize the following benefits salary transparency practices offer.  Promotes fairness and equality: By being transparent about compensation, companies can ensure that they are paying their employees fairly and equitably. This can help to reduce pay disparities and promote a more level playing field for all employees.  Attracts top talent: Candidates are more likely to be interested in working for a transparent company about compensation. This helps them make informed decisions about their career paths and ensures fair payment.  Increases employee satisfaction and engagement: When employees clearly understand their compensation and the factors that determine their pay, they are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and engaged in their work.  Manages expectations: Salary transparency can help to manage expectations and reduce negotiating time and effort. By being open about compensation, HR organizations can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent negotiating salaries and benefits.  Supports legal compliance: Salary transparency is a legal requirement in some countries, and companies must be transparent about compensation to comply with labor laws and regulations. Companies’ transparency about compensation can improve their hiring outcomes and support their employees in making informed career decisions. While no one can fully predict final hiring outcomes for 2023, insightful organizational leaders wanting to attract top performers will continue exploring trends to create workplaces with a strong purpose and the ability to maintain lifestyles with work-life well-being. Leaders will also continue to focus on delivering DEI initiatives, upskilling, and reskilling opportunities while leveraging TXP platforms and AI data recruiting best practices. They will also maintain relationships with former top-performing employees through alumni networks, practice salary transparency and continue finding ways to provide workers with remote and hybrid work options. While the current job market may be facing uncertainty, there are still plenty of opportunities for insightful organizational leaders to attract top talent and create a thriving and dynamic workplace.

            "body": "2023/01/23 - Ever felt like your success was simply fooling people into thinking you were good at your job? If the answer is yes, you may suffer from imposter syndrome, especially if you’re a full-time executive or fractional executive. However, you’re not alone. It’s estimated that 70% of all people with imposter syndrome are in high-powered positions, and Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) are no different. A CTO provides technological vision, leadership, and expertise to develop technical teams and build strategic roadmaps to guide the development of an organization’s products and services. A fractional Chief Technology Officer takes on the role on a part-time basis to help reduce costs and move companies forward. CTOs and Fractional CTOs have the pressure of being both an expert in their field and a leader, which can be overwhelming, even to those with a strong track record of success. You might be worried about learning more about programming, project management, or product design. But there are ways to learn how to cure imposter syndrome as a CTO. What is Imposter Syndrome?: Imposter syndrome describes the feeling that you are not qualified for your job, despite evidence to the contrary. It’s when you persistently believe you’re not good enough, and eventually, you will be exposed as a fraud. With the expectation to know various technical skills and carry leadership responsibilities, you may need more time to fulfill both roles effectively. Regardless of your achievements, self-doubt and fear can derail your efforts to accomplish positive outcomes. You may fear others will judge or question your qualifications from your teams, within your organization, or field. How Can Imposter Syndrome Affect a CTO?: Imposter syndrome can create a ruminating false narrative that your efforts will end in adverse outcomes, especially when you’re starting as a CTO or fractional CTO. If you’re new to the role or looking to gain more traction in your field, imposter syndrome can create the need to overwork yourself or your teams to meet unrealistic high standards that you’ve put in place to compensate for feelings of inadequacy. It can lead to burnout, low job performance, and job dissatisfaction. As a leader, it can affect the day-to-day operations of your teams if you saddle them with too much work. If you and your teams are overloaded and burnt out, symptoms related to stress can surface. Anxiety, lack of sleep, or frustration can cause people to disengage from unhappiness and decrease performance. As a leader, this is the last scenario you want. Part of your role is to set up your teams for success. When your workforce is happy, they’ll perform at their best and deliver high-achieving results. You want to avoid sabotaging success due to imposter syndrome. How to Treat Imposter Syndrome as a CTO or Fractional CTO: The first step toward overcoming imposter syndrome is to give yourself a break and fully understand it’s common. Here are six ways to toss those negative feelings out the window and set you on the path toward preserving the road to success: 1. Maintain a growth mindset: A growth mindset is about focusing on ways to get better and overcome “Impostor syndrome: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing. It’s only a matter of time until everyone finds out. ’ Growth mindset: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing yet. It’s only a matter of time until I figure it out. ’ The highest form of self-confidence is believing in your ability to learn,” says Organizational Psychologist and Work Life podcast host Adam Grant. 2. Look for learning opportunities: When you focus on learning opportunities to strengthen your weaknesses, it redirects your focus from adverse outcomes. Mapping out your career intentions can help ground you and provide you with a list of learning opportunities to overcome fears related to self-perceived shortcomings. 3. Focus on problem-solving for others: A CTO’s role is to support and lead teams. Focusing on solutions for others is a way to deflect attention away from yourself and relax your negative thoughts while building your confidence and expertise. 4. Create a network of support: Create connections with people that can help you in times of need. Whether you’re a full-time or fractional leader, you want to develop a vast network of powerful individual resources to help you solve problems and provide resources to your teams to achieve your goals and initiatives. 5. Make connections with problem-solving allies: You want to build resources and create partners with problem-solving experts to support and drive your initiatives within your client organization. This can help ensure successful outcomes for your projects that will subdue the negative chatter in your mind from imposter syndrome. 6. Delegate your weakness to others: Finding ways to delegate your weaknesses to others possessing the skill sets you lack is a strategy for positive outcomes. It allows you to leverage your strengths, which boosts your self-confidence and provides new growth opportunities among teams and yourself to learn. Can Work as a Fractional CTO Help with Imposter Syndrome?: For those struggling with imposter syndrome, becoming a CTO can be daunting. However, fractional CTO work is a great way to encounter a variety of problem-solving and growth opportunities to hone your expertise toward becoming a full-time leader. CTOs are top contributors to the financial success of companies. Organizations constantly need to manage technology changes and provide solutions to innovate and maintain growth for short and long-term needs. Companies can’t afford the role to go vacant for too long, and fractional CTOs are excellent resources for filling gaps. Both scenarios offer the opportunity to manage various challenges that will hone your ability to direct constant change. It’s also an excellent chance to provide much-needed value to companies. It’s also a way to leverage your existing technical expertise that landed you the job in the first place, while practicing your leadership skills part-time to build confidence. Some of the benefits of fractional CTO work include: Create success through problem-solving: Working as a fractional CTO allows you to tackle the issues that will inevitably arise in organizations going through changes at a reduced cost. The problems you solve will help reduce your imposter syndrome and provide you with confidence-building success stories. Apply existing skills in new ways: You can gain experience by putting your existing skills to work in new scenarios. For example, if you want to expand your expertise and knowledge to a new industry, fractional CTO work is an excellent way to make a change. It allows you to apply expanded assurance to your existing skills in areas where imposter syndrome can appear. Practice leadership skills: Leading and guiding teams through change requires a firm set of calm, confident, soft skills where the challenges can be ambiguous, which is a situation ripe for imposter syndrome. Particularly if you feel like you have the technical know-how but lack leadership experience, fractional CTO work is an excellent way to build relationships. You want to work with people who can offer support and mentorship as you hone your leadership soft skills and move your career forward. How Do You Know if Fractional CTO Work is Right for You? Suppose you’re looking to expand or hone your skillsets to challenge your imposter syndrome tendencies while creating greater flexibility and autonomy in your career. In that case, fractional CTO work might be a good fit for you. To decide whether or not fractional CTO work is right for you, the following is a short list of primary skills required to assess your abilities for the role: 1. You know what it takes to get things done: If you’re an experienced developer, architect, or manager, you already have the skillset and a pretty good idea of what it takes to get the job done. You’ve worked on teams before and know how much effort is required to deliver high-quality products and services. 2. You’re a good communicator: You must communicate clearly with developers, designers, and project managers to effectively accomplish project milestones and goals. So if this isn’t something that comes naturally to you, it may take some time and practice before you can do so effectively as a fractional CTO. To practice, focus on expanding your network to hone your communication skills, and look for small-scale projects you can lead. 3. You have experience leading or managing teams: If you have led technical teams and managed engineers, you can take your skill set to the next level as a fractional CTO. Fractional CTOs are c-level executives who can lead and guide teams to success, which requires the soft skills to manage people effectively. In addition to having technical know-how to perform or understand specific tasks, successful fractional leaders have the professional network and outreach to help hire the appropriate resources to fulfill the skills gaps within teams when necessary. 4. You have experience working remotely: Working as a fractional CTO requires frequent communication with remote colleagues spread out worldwide, sometimes in different time zones. As such, it’s essential that your team members feel comfortable communicating with each other via Slack or another chat app without feeling like they need to be present in person at all times. If you possess all of the above skill sets, exploring fractional CTO work is likely a good fit for you. Otherwise, it’s worth expanding your network and exploring small-scale project opportunities to build the skills you need and help quiet your imposter syndrome. Remember, imposter syndrome doesn’t have to overpower you. If you’re starting your journey as a CTO or looking to break into the role in a fractional capacity, it’s a familiar feeling among high-achieving tech professionals. You can leverage it as fuel to grow your network and find the resources to develop your skills, particularly if you maintain a growth mindset with the willingness to learn. "

            "body": "2023/01/13 - You spend one-third of your lifetime working. How can you navigate what you want your work to mean, and how can you contribute to meaningful employment with purpose? It takes intention. When you use intention to guide your actions, rather than relying on chance, it sets the stage for greater success and happiness along your career journey. What is the Career Journey: The career journey is a series of jobs and life experiences that leads you to your long-term career goals. It’s a continual process of achieving milestones and goals; learning and growing; rediscovering what you have to offer; and contributing to the greater good. Whether you’re at the start or in the middle of your career, your career journey will continue to unfold throughout your life. What if you could create a personal roadmap that shows how you plan to get from where you are now to where you want to be in the future? Learning to map your career journey opens possibilities to evaluate what is important to you, assess how your career contributes to your happiness, and pivot when life throws you a curveball. Even if you’ve never taken the time to map your career journey formally, it’s never too late to evaluate your current situation and consider if you’re happy continuing in that direction. Your insights will guide you to make necessary changes, discover new things about yourself, take the time to enjoy and celebrate your accomplishments, and think about what you want to do next. Your career map documents the steps you want to take in your journey, and how your actions support your goals in a chosen timeline. Mapping your journey encourages regular reflection check-ins with yourself and your career intentions. You can track your progress in the milestones you achieve and the inevitable detours, roadblocks, and side roads you encounter along the way. Your map keeps you on course towards a meaningful and satisfying work life. Identifying Your Values: The first step in mapping a career journey is to define your values, and this requires some deep questioning of yourself. Reflect on your life experiences and find the values that are meaningful to you. It might help to start by identifying people in your life or in public that you admire, and then examining the qualities they possess that are attractive to you. When you have completed your values audit and reflection, you can test your values by asking yourself some challenging questions to determine if your values hold up. For example, if you value authenticity, can you identify times when your authentic self led you to make a difficult decision. How did you feel after doing so? Do you believe you did the right thing? Once you are clear on your values, you can ensure that your actions and goals are in alignment. Your core values give your life meaning, and you can use them to create a compass for your life. This will guide you through the challenging twists and turns you will inevitably encounter, and will help you maintain the career journey you want. When you take measures to intentionally live your values, chances are you’ll be motivated and inspired to express your desires and priorities. Finding Your True North in Your Career Journey: Metaphorically speaking, your true north is your guiding star or a galaxy of possibilities that aligns with your values. Ultimately, it’s how you’d like to contribute to the greater whole and where you’d like to make a difference to keep you engaged, growing, and sustainably happy while learning. Your true north sets the stage for your priorities and goals throughout your career, regardless of circumstance. Circumstances are tricky because they often represent what you can’t fully control. You can choose to see your circumstances as challenges that derail you or as opportunities that steer the direction of your priorities. Events you don’t see coming can either create feelings of burden or of potential achievement. Regardless of circumstances, situations you can’t control can be challenging. Understanding and formulating a relationship with your values defines your true north, and allows you to make optimal choices for your priorities because it feels right even when your options are difficult or painful to make based on circumstances. Your true north keeps you going in the direction of your values and intentions no matter what happens throughout your career journey. Conducting a Skills Inventory: You now have the opportunity to define the next chapter of your career. With clarity around your true north, you can assess where you stand along your journey. You’ve already put in the time to build awareness for what you want. Now it’s time to formulate a plan for getting there by identifying strengths, blockers and dependencies. Here are some ways to get started:  Celebrate existing skills: Celebrate your current skills by recognizing achievements and positive contributions. This can be as simple as taking a moment to write down what went well each day and what you’re proud of accomplishing.    Identify needs: Look at the areas within your skill set that you’ll need to progress to the next milestone or goal within your journey.     Evaluate weakness: Take stock of your weaknesses by asking trusted friends or peers for honest feedback on your work performance and development opportunities.   Build a backlog: Create a backlog of things you want to learn, allowing you to prioritize learning opportunities over time.  Prioritize and attack: Prioritize which skill gaps need addressing now by identifying which ones are holding you back from doing your best work in the future. If you need to develop new skill sets, then be intentional with how you fill in skill gaps. Set aside time and resources to learn relevant skills that align with your values and direction instead of rushing to learn something new. It’s easy for distractions to take over. There’s always a new shiny object that grabs at our focus. Keep track of what is most important right now, and focus on those first before moving on to the next priority. Be deliberate about how you spend your time and energy. Learning is a lifelong process, so it’s crucial to cultivate an attitude of curiosity and openness toward learning new things. This will allow you to continue developing throughout your life and, even better, build a foundation for lifelong learning. During this phase of your investigation, it’s easy for distractions to take over. There’s always a new shiny object that grabs at our focus. Keep track of what is most important right now, and focus on those first before moving on to the next priority. Be deliberate about how you spend your time and energy. Remember that mastery is different for everyone, but it often starts with setting goals for what success looks like for each skill gap that needs filling. For example, if there’s a programming language or framework that you want to master, then decide what level of proficiency that means for yourself: basic knowledge or expert understanding. This can help keep you motivated along the way by showing progress toward mastery. Finally, maintain your skills backlog by keeping track of what you’ve learned and the projects you’ve completed with your acquired skills. This will not only keep you on your journey, but it is immensely satisfying to review how far you have come. Pause here and assess if you are ready to start mapping your career journey. Can you articulate your values and see when your decisions are aligned? Have you found your true north? Is your skills inventory complete? Now it’s time to start your map. Tips for Building your Career Map: Creating your career map is a way to proactively identify desired opportunities that match your values and interests, rather than reacting to prospects that won’t move you towards your desired goals. When you are ready to start mapping, you can follow these steps:  The first step is to gather career resources for your ideal position, such as job descriptions, required skills, personality profiles, training, and development. You need this research to ensure that you fully understand the opportunities and challenges of your journey.  Next you will set a goal for your ideal career. What skills do you need to achieve that role? For example, if you desire to be a project manager, what did you learn from your research about the skills and availability of that career? If you will need to develop more skills to achieve your goal, consider how you might build the appropriate skill set. Maybe it requires that you take a series of small promotions, or maybe you’ll require some retraining.  At some point in the journey, you may recognize that it is useful to create small milestones toward your goal. Map how to advance from one point to another. It’s okay If your map is not linear, you can map your various positions and draw connections between them. Consider seminars, higher education, and certifications that will support your career journey. Advancing in your career may seem like a monumental task. Set bite-sized objectives to strive toward more significant accomplishments and build confidence to create experiences you’re proud to share. Measuring Your Career Progress &amp; Introspection: Maintaining your career map reminds you to measure your progress and set reflective points during your journey that support feelings of fulfillment, accomplishment, and happiness. Measurement allows you to know the actual output of your effort. It’s wise to create deadlines, milestones, objectives, and key results to document and reflect upon them regularly so that you can examine your progress, pivot when necessary, and remain motivated. Reflection time on your journey puts life’s challenges into perspective, and opens opportunities for you to consider. You can thrive by reflecting on what you value most in work and in life, and what is keeping you from being your best self. When work absorbs so much of your time and attention, you owe it to yourself to find meaning in what you do daily. During times of introspection, ask yourself:  What works for you at work? It’s important to ponder and write these qualities down, so you don’t run in a repeating loop. Include how you feel about the physical environment, the people, access to opportunities, harmony between work and life, and how work aligns with your values.  What makes you stand out? When you get good at something, you can leverage your value in remarkably satisfying and impactful ways.  How do you relate to the world? When you are using your energy to match a work environment that isn’t a natural space for you, you are less available to perform at your highest potential.  What type of impact do you want to make? You can find ways to work it into your daily life, both in and out of the workplace. Focusing with intention, taking the time to reflect on your values, and mapping your career journey lays the foundation for achieving and maintaining happiness in your life and in your career. It’s worth the effort, and your future self will thank you.  This article was originally published in Forbes. "

            "body": "2022/10/18 - Companies want to hire C-level executives to help them grow. However, with rapidly changing needs and an unpredictable environment, many companies may not be able to budget for a full-time C-level executive. Fast-paced organizations or companies in transition can hire an experienced leader part-time to move a company forward. Hiring fractional executives helps corporations mitigate costs and evaluate new potential leaders. A fractional executive works in a fractional capacity, helping small and large companies to offload the burden of having a c-level executive in-house full-time. What Are the Types of Fractional Executives?: The C-level acts as the chief executives in a company, driving their organizations to grow and leading operational changes to remain competitive. They make up an organization’s leadership suite in several different roles representing expertise. Most of us know the typical C-level executive positions available such as:  CEO (Chief Executive Officer) CFO (Chief Financial Officer) CTO (Chief Technology Officer) CIO (Chief Information office) CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)Today, a wide range of C-level titles spin off these traditional acronyms. With so many variations for the chief executive label available, CXO is now a known term with the “X” representing the collective term for C-level or C-suite executive. Sometimes roles overlap, and it’s not uncommon for executives to wear multiple hats. For example, an IT executive could take on the part of a CIO or CTO, or both. CIOs typically oversee IT departments and make strategic decisions about an organization’s hardware and software associated with networking systems, work staff, and customer service needs. CTOs typically focus more on the innovation aspects of the business. They oversee a business’s existing and new technology needs to develop strategic products and services. Their goal is to help grow business while keeping an eye on maintaining and optimizing technology infrastructure. But what happens when a company doesn’t quite have the budget or resources for either role? One solution is to hire fractional C-level executives, such as a fractional CTO. It’s not out of reach for a highly experienced C-level IT executive to take on a part-time role as a fractional executive to help an organization grow and optimize costs. What are the Benefits of Fractional Work for a C-level Executive?: Executives have a lot to gain from fractional roles. While fractional executives provide companies with the opportunity to save money and optimize resources, fractional work is an opportunity to make significant impacts within organizations, maintain a variety of exciting experiences, create flexibility in their work-life, and make more money. The fractional leadership model can benefit C-level executives and companies alike. Some of the benefits include:  Make an Impact: Fractional executives can make a real difference. They have the potential to cause significant impacts in shorter periods. This is because day-to-day management responsibilities do not bog them down. Also, they’re less likely to get caught up in politics. The part-time nature of their position provides less opportunity for internal politics to overshadow their decision-making. As a result, fractional executives tend to devote more time and energy to strategic thinking and implementation. With a greater focus on results, they have more opportunities to make meaningful strides toward company growth.  Gain Variety: Being a fractional executive is an ideal way for an experienced person to work on solving challenging problems with various great companies without having to commit to one company full time. Fractional executives can choose projects that pique their interests and cater to their strengths. They’re well positioned for success while learning new skills to add knowledge and experience to their repertoire.  Create Flexibility: Becoming a fractional executive is a viable option for achieving work-life balance. Fractional executives can take on multiple clients and make more money with greater flexibility. Fractional executives work on a per-project basis with no obligation for ongoing employment. They can choose when they want to work and how much time they want to dedicate to each client, enabling them to structure their schedules and avoid burnout. What Qualifications Do You Need to Be a Fractional Executive?: A fractional executive have similar but scaled-down sets of responsibilities compared to their full-time counterparts. Fractional executives generally have at least a bachelor’s degree, and many, if not most, have master’s degrees. If you’re interested in becoming a fractional executive, you must show leadership experience in managing groups of people to implement change. It’s also necessary to offer the ability to scale resources, harness innovation, and effectively manage relationships with key stakeholders. In addition to a successful track record, the following skills can help you stand out from the crowd:  Strategic thinking: C-level fractional executives deeply understand their industries and organizations’ challenges and opportunities to make strategic decisions. Your ability as a fractional executives will be judged by how well you can take charge during change and uncertainty.  Team management: Fractional executives must work with teams on different levels of an organization, from the sales teams that report directly to you or marketing teams that register through your department head to executives who report directly to your boss’s boss or above. Your ability to communicate effectively with people at all levels is essential for success in the job.  Superior communication skills: Some essential skills fractional C-suite executives must possess are the soft skills required to manage people effectively, including exceptional communication skills. Fractional executives must have the ability to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders from different backgrounds and industries. They need to be able to act as an intermediary between various departments within an organization and between organizations.  High emotional intelligence: Fractional executives must also possess high emotional intelligence and understand other people’s emotions. This includes understanding their emotions to respond accordingly without letting them get in the way of making rational decisions or supporting others.  Dedication: While the position is part-time, fractional executives must be willing to show they’re 100% dedicated to the outcomes of the results they’re trying to achieve. Ultimately, fractional executives want their clients to feel like they’re receiving full-time attention.  Laser-sharp scope management: Fractional executives must be able to manage scope firmly. They need to be comfortable with handling the duality of conflicting priorities, which requires the ability to make confident decisions, delegate projects, and create boundaries. If you feel like you have the right skills, experience, and credentials to become a fractional executive, then it’s a worthy option to explore, but fractional executive work isn’t for everyone. How Do You Know if Fractional Executive Work is Right for You?: If you’re considering a fractional executive role and want to leverage your extensive experience to create greater flexibility and autonomy in your career, asking yourself the following questions can help determine whether fractional executive work is the right path.  Are you drawn to challenging business growth opportunities? Do you like variety and have an entrepreneurial spirit? Are you comfortable with creating direction and leading through ambiguity? Do you have expertise in a particular area that would lend itself well to this work? Do you have any barriers that could prevent you from fractional work? What are your motivations behind exploring fractional work?While these are important questions to consider when assessing the viability of pursuing fractional executive work, don’t allow yourself to be dissuaded if you find that you don’t possess all the skills or traits to do the work. The need and options for fractional executives are growing, and taking on small pilot projects is another way you can explore whether or not fractional work is the path for you. However, suppose you’re an experienced C-level executive with a proven successful track record and like variety in your career. If you want to make an impact, earn more money, and have the freedom to structure your schedule, then becoming a fractional executive is likely an excellent choice. "

            "title": "Why Fractional Screening is a Great Side-Hustle for Developers",
            "thumbnail": "/uploads/fractionalscreening.jpg",
            "body": "2022/09/29 - Fractional screening is a great side hustle for web engineers with skills, experience, and some free time in their schedules. Screeners can earn additional income while using their skills to match open roles with qualified developers among their colleagues. Hiring organizations also benefit from this arrangement because they can evaluate a larger pool of potential candidates by leveraging fractional screeners to help manage their recruiting efforts and resources. What is Fractional Screening?: The traditional recruitment process is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. It requires a lot of human resources to manage the administration process for interviewing candidates and filtering out those who are not qualified despite the advances with AI sourcing tools. This is especially true for technical positions, where there are often hundreds of applicants. Fractional screening is a recruitment outsourcing option that leverages professional developers with a niche or advanced technical knowledge to tackle the vetting and prequalifying filtration step during the candidate assessment process. Fractional screeners are highly skilled professional developers who can provide technical interviewer services that can accurately evaluate candidates’ skills and abilities based on their experience in a particular technology, language, or platform. When hiring managers fold fractional screening into their wheelhouse of technical screening tools it gives them access to many qualified candidates at a fraction of what it would typically cost to vet technical candidates internally. Without losing control over their organization’s recruiting process or sacrificing quality assurance, it alleviates the burden of screening and evaluating candidates. Why Should I Find a Fractional Screening Gig?: If you’re an experienced developer, this is an excellent way to earn extra income for paid interviews while providing your skills and expertise to companies that need them. If you haven’t considered fractional screening as an opportunity in the past, consider the numerous benefits a fractional screening gig has to offer. Financial Stability: As a fractional worker, you can combine multiple streams of income. This means that you can earn money whenever and wherever you want. You’ll be able to find work as needed and take on projects when you have time. Flexibility: Fractional workers have more control over their schedules. You set your hours and work on your schedule. You can choose which projects you want to work on, thus giving you more control over how much money you earn each month. This is especially important if you have other responsibilities outside of work, such as caring for children or elderly family members. It’s particularly appealing if you want to work part-time while continuing your full-time, attending school full-time or part-time, or taking the time to pursue personal goals. Control: As a fractional worker you’ll have the ability to choose how much or how little you want to work. You can set your schedule so that it fits into your life. You can even take breaks during the week if necessary. You’ll also have the freedom to choose the types of assignments most appealing. . You’ll have access to thousands of jobs and can apply for whatever projects interest you most. The pay is often more competitive than full-time positions, so even if the hours don’t match up perfectly with your schedule, it’s still worth considering as an alternative to a full-time job. As a fractional screener, you’ll be able to pick the jobs you want to do and the companies you want to engage for business, allowing control and freedom to manage your schedule. Work from Anywhere: As the remote-hybrid paradigm takes hold, working from anywhere has become more important. This is simply good business practice because several studies have shown a large portion of the workforce claim that remote work allows them to be more productive. For example, 77% of those who work remotely at least a few times per month show increased productivity, with 30% doing more work in less time and 24% doing more in the same period, according to a survey by ConnectSolutions. Working from anywhere allows you to work with greater concentration and less distraction. Avoiding commutes and office distractions enable people to get more work done in less time, ultimately providing greater happiness. Fractional screening opportunities are usually fully remote, so you can work when and where it’s most convenient for you. Autonomy: There are many benefits to a fractional screening gig, such as autonomy. Fractional screeners can “be their own boss,” at least to some degree. With autonomy, you have the freedom to work in a way that suits you best. While fractional workers will need to take the time to understand their clients’ processes and business needs to set themselves up for success. By establishing relationships with stakeholders and understanding client processes, fractional screeners will have the freedom to work independently on their terms. Helping Businesses: Despite the technology advancements associated with hiring technical professionals, IT managers still struggle to keep up with the hiring demands for software engineers, developers, and technology architects. As a result, technical debt builds for IT teams, and fractional screening can help. Fractional screeners add bandwidth to a business’ screening and hiring process, allowing companies to scale their development teams with on-demand talent. They ensure that only qualified applicants are submitted for open roles, which ultimately supports the technical assessment process saving the growing organization valuable time and money with streamlined hiring processes and boosted scalability. Helping Talent: Fractional screeners have the experience and deep knowledge to match each applicant with the best roles they can handle, to ensure the right candidates fulfill appropriate roles, ensuring success for both developers and employers. While going through the technical screening interview process can be intimidating for growing software developers, fractional screeners help talent expand and grow their skill sets, giving constructive feedback on how they can improve and strengthen their skills while practicing interviewing. How Can I Get Started with Fractional Screening Jobs?: It’s not difficult to get started with fractional screening as a technical interviewer to evaluate tech candidates. Suppose you know how to code well enough to assess candidates’ technical ability. In that case, you’re already on your way to learning screening methods for determining developers to fulfill a consistent and steady demand for top tech talent. Overall the benefits of a fractional screening gig as a side hustle are abundant. Fractional screening gigs can provide:  Additional financial stability, Control over how much you work Ability to work from anywhere Autonomy to be your own boss The option to work from anywhereUltimately, you’ll help businesses and talent thrive while earning a few extra dollars, and everybody wins.

            "thumbnail": "/uploads/pexels-canva-studio-3194519.jpg",
            "body": "2022/09/12 - The hybrid model has now taken hold. Companies have become aware of the benefits of remote and office-based work. Statistics show, however, that employees want a flexible remote hybrid model. A recent report from Condeco found that 85% of their 1500 US-based workers desire remote and hybrid work options. Employees increasingly want employers to allow them to function from anywhere and anytime, across whatever time zones. As a result, companies should aim to meet their employees’ desires for remote hybrid work. While many companies during the pandemic were able to transition to remote hybrid work quickly, an unprecedented shift in traditional workplaces and the way we work is taking shape. What Is Remote Hybrid Work?: Remote Hybrid work is a combination of working in the office and working remotely. Working remotely can include operating from home, or working for a company without a headquarters. In solely remote companies, employees work from wherever they want, including outside of their home country. Working remotely can also include shared workplaces or coworking spaces, like coffee shops, lounges, or workspace rentals. These spaces also offer shared housing and hoteling options for individual remote workers, or for teams to gather in a chosen central destination. Hybrid models require flexibility to accommodate working across time zones while balancing others’ needs. Remote hybrid work combines both models. However, remote hybrid work is more than WFH on MWF and commuting into the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It’s an elastic combination of employees working together, based on location and schedules. With remote hybrid models, as long as teams can coordinate with each other to complete deliverables, finish projects, and accomplish milestones to complete company objectives, employees can choose where and when they want to work. Remote Coworking Increases Revenue: For companies adopting a remote hybrid model, remote coworking spaces offer many benefits to companies looking for ways to reduce real estate costs, increase well-being and productivity. It’s also a way for organizations to become central coworking hubs to bring their remote hybrid employees together in exciting places for innovation and collaboration. Providing remote coworking spaces for the workforce is one way companies can save a bundle, which brings in more revenue. Before the pandemic, coworking spaces such as Mindspace and Office Evolution touted cost savings of 20% to 40% for companies investing in shared workspaces versus traditional leased office space. Global Workplace Analytics has done extensive research on the benefits of remote and flexible work, which includes insights to the significant real estate savings organizations can save by ditching their long-term lease investments. For example their aggregated research showed:  IBM slashed real estate costs by $50 million Average real estate savings with full-time telework is $10,000/employee/year Sun Microsystems saves $68 million a year in real estate costsNow, coworking spaces are back in demand. Recent reports from the Business Research Company expects the global coworking space market to reach $30 billion in 2026 from $13 billion in 2021. Flexible Workspaces Create a Productive Culture: Over the past three years, companies have focused even more on providing flexible workspaces that cater to a remote hybrid workforce. The benefits? Enhanced company culture, in-person connection, and promoted well-being among employees. Atlassian and Salesforce are leading the trend right now. For example, Atlassian recently launched its Team Anywhere office from Austin. And, Salesforce created Trail Blazer Ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains. In addition to cost savings, organizations providing coworking spaces can benefit from productivity gains. Companies offering subsidized coworking memberships to their employees show they take their workforce needs seriously. Coworking spaces can help overcome the challenges associated with remote hybrid work significantly. Many employees experience isolation, lack of structure, and blurred boundaries between personal and work time while working from home. When employers offer coworking options, workers can experience increased well-being and quality of life, resulting in greater productivity. Remote Hybrid Workspaces Provide Community: Even if your workforce has adapted well toward creating private workspaces within their homes, it’s still easy to fall out of balance. The personal needs of household members or the to-do list to manage home life can easily disrupt a workday. A surefire way to tackle the issues associated with remote hybrid work is for companies to provide the option of a remote shared workspaces. A remote shared workspace can provide employees with the structure and boundaries needed to create more focus, mitigate personal distractions and overcome feelings of isolation. A shared workspace can immediately reduce the problem of loneliness related to isolation, particularly in spaces with other remote workers. Long before the pandemic coworking hubs became widely popular among freelancers and a growing number corporate teleworkers. The benefits are hard to deny. The following Harvard Business Review research study surveying members of co-working spaces show:  79% said co-working expanded their social networks 83% reported they are less lonely since joining a co-working space 89% reported they are happier since joining a co-working spaceShared Workspaces Offer Focus: In addition to reducing feelings of isolation, becoming a member of a shared workspace can provide the structure needed to focus on work. Shared working environments are excellent sources for technology hubs providing high-speed internet access and plenty of ports to keep your devices charged. Members of co-working hubs surveyed in the Harvard Business Review study reported fewer distractions than working from home or in a coffee shop. Co-working spaces provide the feeling of working from the office and give workers the structure and the boundaries they need to focus and create a better work-life balance. Shared work environments can provide stronger boundaries between work and home life with the following:  A focused workplace outside of home to mitigate distractions A reason to dress for success and conduct video calls in a professional manner An ability to create boundaries for work hours that won’t impede personal timeWhen workers can concentrate better, they can function more efficiently and proactively. Shared workspaces and options present remote workers the choice of their preferred work environments. When companies provide various workspace options, employees have the chance to perform at their best. Coworking spaces give companies and their staff more choices in their work-life. It shows employers are willing to take action. It also leverages an opportunity to save money. Ultimately, shared workspaces create win-win scenarios for employers and employees shifting to the remote hybrid model. "

            "body": "2022/08/18 - If you work in a distributed workforce or lead teams among remote and hybrid workforce models, remote team retreats are a highly effective way for your organization to collaborate. Not only can offsite retreats help build company culture and shared values, but they’re also essential for increasing productivity, learning development, strategizing company objectives, and sparking innovation. What is a Remote Team Retreat?: A remote team retreat is an opportunity for remote organizations to bring employees together in person. It’s a chance to get away from the day-to-day routine and focus on what matters most – connection among teams and company priorities. With all the daily distractions and demands at your home office or hybrid workplace, it can be hard to find the time to reflect on your work goals. Sometimes it’s challenging to take a step back and simply focus on human interaction with your colleagues without a work agenda. A remote work retreat allows you to hit the reset button, learn something new, foster more profound insights, and create stronger connections with your colleagues. Why Host a Remote Team Retreat?: With more companies embracing hybrid and remote work models, many organizations have to shift their best practices of team building and company culture. Some companies are choosing to close their offices permanently and invest in offsite remote team retreats. Hosting a team offsite is a powerful remote team building and company camaraderie opportunity. It brings teams together in an informal setting that promotes collaboration and fun while allowing staff to connect with each other on a more personal level. They are also an excellent way to foster relationships between coworkers who may not get the chance to interact with each other on a daily basis. If you’re looking for ways to bring your teams and organization together to boost your company’s performance and solidify a vision, here are 8 reasons why your company needs a remote team retreat. 1. Build Company Culture: Leaders need to keep their workforce updated with the company vision and objectives to maintain a strong culture and keep people focused on the same goals, which creates better outcomes for success. When managing a remote team or hybrid organization, building culture and creating a collective employee experience with a shared vision can be challenging. When you manage to get everyone in the same place, keeping everyone engaged and focused on company goals can be tricky. Remote team retreats are a great way to address both issues. When you bring employees together offsite away from their home offices or local workspaces, particularly in an inspiring location with team building and learning activities, everyone has the opportunity to be focused and engaged. Fostering a shared vision while getting to know each other better during a group experience helps build company culture. 2. Promote and Provide Learning Development: Offsite company retreats also provide a unique opportunity for employees to develop and learn as individuals and in groups. For example, providing a session on time management can help your teams manage themselves better for personal and organizational success. Providing learning opportunities that enable your teams to explore personal, group, and organizational goals will help everyone leave on the same page. For instance, suppose leaders want to be more strategic with incorporating their company’s mission or vision into specific team objectives and operational plans. A remote work retreat can give leaders the chance to educate their teams with a better understanding of their company, and explore new approaches of how groups must function to meet company milestones. A team offsite also can help your teams practice skills and develop a functional understanding of their personal leadership abilities. They enable your teams to explore how the dynamics of their groups flesh out by providing experiences that allow your teams to explore each other’s personal differences in a safe and controlled atmosphere. 3. Strategize: A remote team retreat is an opportunity to discuss your strategy for the next six months or year and brainstorm strategies on how to achieve collective goals cross-functionally. It allows leaders to align everyone on the same page and get feedback on what they need from their managers or other departments to succeed. Leaders can facilitate strategic interactive planning sessions to gather buy-in for their current mission and develop transparent planning processes for their company objectives. It’s a way to collectively gather specific information and ideas from their team members and stakeholders across the organization. Strategic interactive sessions also can pave the way to uncover or resolve organizational barriers and potential team roadblocks, which can help set reasonable expectations and spark innovative ideas to solve problems. 4. Spark Innovation: Do you want to disrupt an existing market or find new ways to expand your products and services? Innovation is the key to making your organization stand out and solve problems no one else can. Offsite team retreats pull people out of their traditional settings and create time and space for new ideas to emerge and thrive through collaboration in a safe place. When team members are in a safe space, they’re more likely to ask questions, admit mistakes, and share learnings. Giving your teams practice to foster curiosity and feel comfortable sharing ideas without fear of judgment will help build innovative teams more likely to achieve company goals and adapt to challenges and change with greater resilience. 5. Increase Productivity: Increased productivity is one of the many benefits why team building is important. Team building for remote workers is essential to help increase motivation and promote cooperation. Teams don’t bond overnight. It can take time for people to feel comfortable and build trust with one another. When you host a remote team retreat with activities and events, you provide the chance for your remote workforce to bond. Bonded teams are more productive because they’re likely to be more committed to supporting one another and reaching collective company goals. Team building gives your workforce the chance to learn how their colleagues best operate and understand one another better. It improves communication and trust breaking ground for teams to work more efficiently with each other to save time and energy. 6. Attract and Retrain Top Talent: In the current job market, attracting talented employees is still challenging. Employees that offer hybrid and remote work options, along with opportunities to mitigate burnout, foster learning and development, and provide time and space where employees can connect beyond the workplace, are desirable to top talent and younger generations. Remote team retreats show employees you’re a forward-thinking company that invests in workforce development. It’s an action that shows you value your teams enough to invest in them, especially when distributed workforces have less opportunity for face-to-face interaction. Beyond the standard vacation, health care, and 401K benefits, remote work retreats can be considered an additional perk to attract A-list employees. Offsite retreats in places rich in nature or culture are a fantastic way for companies to promote well-being and have fun. Employees that play together stay together. Employees who connect and build stronger relationships during remote team events and learning activities often perform better, creating more employee satisfaction. Employees are less likely to look for other opportunities if they are happy. Bonded employees also have greater loyalty and responsibility toward supporting each other and the company’s vision, which fuels dedication and a greater willingness to endure company challenges and changes through growth and expansion, thus generating more company revenue. 7. Strengthen Your Team Bonds across Borders: A remote team retreat gives distributed workforces the ability to interact with their coworkers face-to-face and feel like they’re a part of the same team, despite being dispersed. Teams will have a better chance of understanding how their teammates collaborate and communicate, which helps them improve their relationships with others on their teams. It also can help bridge communication gaps and provide insights toward solving problems that wouldn’t occur otherwise because in-person interaction gives people the chance to understand each other’s differences and points of view with greater clarity. 8. Spread Brand Awareness: A remote team retreat also can be a marketing opportunity. It’s an opportunity to invite key stakeholders, partners, or local customers and sponsor networking opportunities with your brand, allowing your team members to meet and interact with people they usually wouldn’t meet. It’s another way for companies to strengthen a company’s brand awareness and reputation in the marketplace. Company retreats can help solidify connections with all the people that created success for your organization. Plus, if you host a successful remote team retreat, your employees are more likely to become brand ambassadors, promoting your organization as a great workplace. In the end, hosting a successful team retreat all comes down to creating a space where everyone feels comfortable. It gives leaders and their teams the chance to come together and collaborate in ways that will further encourage better productivity and growth. "

            "body": "2022/07/25 - Chief technology officers (CTO) or fractional CTOs often focus on keeping the process of the most up-to-date technology systems running and leading their teams. With these responsibilities, it’s tempting to push networking aside, especially if you’re short on time. However, highly influential CTOs recognize that networking is an integral and vital part of their career and company’s success. Today networking is much more than the simple transactional aspects of business development. While it has the potential to help you find new client opportunities to secure projects for career advancement, it can provide you with endless learning opportunities and the ability to help others too. Here are a few of our top tips for networking as a Chief Technology Officer or as a fractional CTO. Develop a Personal Networking Strategy: Developing a personal networking strategy will help you stay grounded and make the most of your networking efforts. Ideally, you want to focus on creating meaningful connections that will resonate with you. Take a moment and reflect on your communication style to start. If you’re more of an introvert or more neurodivergent, establishing healthy boundaries can help you stay grounded. If you feel overwhelmed in large groups, you might want to choose networking activities where you have the opportunity to connect with others in small groups. For Albert Volkman, attending conferences and events seemed like a natural fit because he is naturally gregarious. But Volkman still doesn’t consider attending events always easy.  “My mantra is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. I try to put myself into positions where I want to learn. If you look at attending conferences and events to find learning experiences, it can get you to a place where you can take the next step toward trying something new, and it can be a lot more fun. ” Attend Tech Meetups and Conferences: One way a CTO can network is by attending tech meetups or conferences organized by local chapters of organizations such as the National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT) or Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA), or groups such as Women Who Code. These types of groups often have regular speaker series and lunch-and-learn events where you can meet members face-to-face and gain the opportunity to connect with other CTOs and technologists. Kit Colbert, CTO of VMware pointed toward the value he gained from networking with customers at the VMworld conference in 2021 (now VMexplore).  “I forgot how enjoyable it can be to engage in the random conversations you strike up around the table. I was able to talk about VMware strategy, learn from customers about their pain points, and meet some new people. ” Speak at Events: Speaking at events is an excellent way to boost your visibility within the industry or the industries associated with your expertise. It can help build your brand as a thought leader in your field. Plus, it doesn’t just benefit you. Speaking at events can also help your company by raising its profile and attracting new talent among attendees. So how do you go about finding speaking engagements?  Research the events, conferences, and meetups where you envision yourself speaking.  Look to see if events and conferences have speaker submission forms.  Connect with leaders of the event or organization and ask if they’d be open to you speaking at an event.  Be prepared to submit a proposal explaining why event organizers should choose you or pitch context-worthy speaking ideas.  Develop a presentation on a topic you’d like to speak about and upload the deck to a service such as SpeakerMatch, which lets you search for the most relevant speaking engagements based on your expertise to ensure you’d be a good fit. Another way to locate speaking opportunities is to find a tech community. Fellow members and event organizers often become good friends and colleagues, which can lead to speaking opportunities. Join a Community: Leveraging your professional communities, associations, or alumni groups is another way to expand your network, find learning and growth opportunities, and access support. Communities can give you referral potential to either help you find new business or create partnerships with organizations that can fulfill expertise gaps in your company. “According to the famous six degrees of separation principle, our personal contacts are valuable to the extent that they help us reach, in as few connections as possible, the far-off person who has the information we need,” says the Harvard Business Review, reminding leaders how they can create and use networks for support. Perhaps you’re looking for some part-time CTO expertise to scale your business. Accessing a fractional CTO and the community associated with it can provide you with cost and time-saving benefits. A fractional CTO can engage in decision making and cross-functional communications throughout your organizations, freeing your leaders up to focus on more innovative and proprietary projects to maintain your company’s competitive edge. Be an Active Listener: Active listening is a way of listening that focuses on understanding the other person’s thoughts and feelings. It’s a skill that will help you build trust with your community, which allows you to learn about other’s business needs, and can provide you with deeper insights to create meaningful connections. What are ways to be an active listener?  Listen for feelings, not just facts.  Be open to what they say or don’t say.  Be curious. Ask open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer, for example, “How did you feel about that event” or “Have you learned anything new or exciting lately?” Ask permission before jumping into a complex subject area or question or sharing personal information about yourself with someone, for example, “would it be okay if I told you about my personal experience with this?”Active listening is also a great way to practice soft skills. It will make you a better communicator, show empathy, and build stronger relationships because it encourages people who aren’t as confident with their speaking skills to voice their opinions without feeling shy or nervous about how others will react when they speak up. Ask for Help: If you’re the CTO or a Fractional CTO of a company, you are the go-to person for technical problems. You may often feel like you’re the only one who can solve them. Asking for help isn’t a bad thing. It’s an essential part of making connections. It doesn’t make you look weak; it shows you dare to be open and actively solve problems when you’re stuck instead of avoiding potentially costly problems. What you learn from others will only help you build your network further. Asking for help builds your network of experts, allowing you to access more knowledge than you could on your own. Whether it’s a new tool or process that could streamline your workflow or an expert who could advise on an issue you’re facing, asking someone in your network for help is a great way to get answers quickly, potentially find new talent for your team, or build trust with others who might not have considered your company. For instance, when looking for someone who has the experience and skills you need, look beyond your personal network. You may find the exact person who will fulfill your talent gaps at the right price point with a network of their own that can help you expand. Mentor or Coach: Mentoring and coaching are other ways to expand your network while building symbiotic learning opportunities. Typically, mentoring involves someone who has already built a successful career in an industry or profession, sharing their knowledge with someone who wants to achieve similar success. It’s a one-on-one relationship where the mentor teaches the mentee how they achieved success in their field. Coaching can occur on a larger scale with groups of people who are trying to achieve similar goals or overcome challenges in their careers. Coaches are trained to ask insightful questions and give feedback to clients so that they can reach their goals or overcome challenges in and out of the workplace. Mentoring and coaching can be done on an informal basis or through formal programs like those offered at places such as the Silicon Valley Executive Mentoring Group (SVEMG) or the CTO Academy for coaching. Joining such programs puts you in contact with other CTOs and provides you with both growing and learning opportunities. You can choose to work with a mentor or coach for your development, or you can mentor other CTOs on best practices. In either case, the goal is to help someone develop their knowledge or skills. As a CTO, mentoring and coaching skills will help your employees grow and develop the necessary skills within your organization to keep your business moving forward. Over time, investing in coaching enables employees to become valuable contributors who can take over some of your responsibilities when necessary, allowing you to spend more time on strategic projects that benefit your company as a whole rather than just managing day-to-day operations. Schedule Regular Check-ins with Key Contacts: If you’re short on time, you may not have time for a full-on networking strategy. Therefore, making time for the people who can help you will keep you in the fold of new happenings, stay connected, and spark new ways to keep you’re network active. It will help keep those relationships strong, and that could lead to new opportunities down the line. When scheduling regular check-ins with key contacts, here are a few things to keep in mind:  Be generous with giving credit and praise where due.  When someone does something good for you, acknowledge their efforts by thanking them and giving them credit for what they did.  Be sure not to take all the credit yourself. Let others know how much their contributions matter. Remember, networking never stops. It is a process of continuous growth and improvement. If you focus on creating a personal networking strategy, carve out time to connect and help others while actively listening to people’s business needs, you will no doubt grow your personal network, find new opportunities, and develop your business. If you need help building up a network of fractional CTO clients, or just looking to connect with other members, join us! "

            "body": "2022/07/19 - At Esteemed, we’re passionate about building community amongst our peers. One of our goals is to get to know our colleagues as well as we possibly can, so that we can market them in the best way possible and offer our clientele with the confidence of high-quality talent. A way we try to foster community and connection among clients and members is through the use of voluntary profile images in our platform. We believe it’s nice to see each other face-to-face, and remind one another that there is a human on the other side of the comment, chat, or thread. Sometimes our members forget to upload a photo, and recently we wanted to audit which profiles in our platform did not have profile images. I’ve worked extensively with Slack’s API, so I thought surely I could filter users by a flag within the user objects. Within the user. profile object you can easily see links to the variations of the user’s avatar. As a default or fall-back to a user with an empty profile photo, Slack will search for the Gravatar associated with their email, or provide an image showcasing the letter of their first name. An image of a letter isn’t a great reference image for other members or clients to get to know who they are talking to. At this stage, we knew who did or didn’t have images, but no way to automate the process of filtering between faces and non-faces so we could follow up and see if anyone could update their image. With over 1,500 members, the sifting of faces and non-faces would be no small task! At this point, I was concerned that I had hit a dead-end. However, I got to thinking… we now have some amazingly talented people who have trained AI models to detect faces. Is that something we could utilize here? After asking our community and doing a little bit of research, I discovered this handy node module. With the module, I could retrieve a list of the user IDs and associated avatars via the aforementioned users. lists Slack endpoint. I now had an array of objects with a link to each avatar. I then put together the following code: users. filter(u =&gt; {  const img = await canvas. loadImage(u. image);  const detections = await faceapi. detectAllFaces(img, faceDetectionOptions);  return detections. length == 0; });However, you cannot run asynchronous operations within Array. prototype. filter(). Further, as I would later find out, doing it this way would quickly get you blocked via Slack’s API rate limiting. So, I switched to doing it to the ol’ fashioned synchronous way: let usersWithoutAvatars = []for (let i = 0; i &lt; users. length; i++) { const img = await canvas. loadImage(users[i]. image); const detections = await faceapi. detectAllFaces(img, faceDetectionOptions); if (detections. length == 0) usersWithoutAvatars. push(data[i]);}Alright, almost there! We now have a beautiful list of all the users who we need. I then used fs to write the output to a CSV file. From there, I imported that dataset into Google Sheets to view. We needed a quick way to visualize and test possible false-positives from the face-api call. Armed with just a spreadsheet full of over 900 links, this would have taken hours! Luckily, Google Sheets has the following handy formula: =Arrayformula(image(&lt;cell&gt;))Adding this formula to the column following the URL, we now magically had a rendered copy of the linked image directly within the Google Sheet! Applying that same formula to the rest of the column provided us with the results we were looking for. We could now rifle through the list and identify the false-positives, compile a list of users, and connect and request that they update their avatars from the default Slack image to a picture of their smiling face. If you’re managing a remote community, or looking for more integration of technology and relationship-building, reach out to us for more information! "

            "thumbnail": "/uploads/screeningdevelopers_thumb.jpg",
            "body": "2022/06/29 - Midway through 2022, we continue to adapt to the most significant workplace disruption in decades. Talent Experience and human-centric workplaces remain the center of focus to leverage a highly skilled and resourceful workforce to ensure the success of organizations and the future of work. As hiring disruptions from 2020 trends play out, leaders tackle the best ways to attract top-performing freelancers and retain A-list employees. Here are some of the ongoing hiring trends for 2022. 1. Employers Fully Embrace Remote and Hybrid Work: At the beginning of 2022, a Harvard Business Review article cited that more than 90% of employers plan to adopt hybrid working models to retain and attract employees. Employee turnover continues to increase as hybrid and remote work become the norm for knowledge workers. Employees are demanding remote and flexible work arrangements, and returning to the office is becoming less common. According to Gartner’s research, flexibility over when, where, and how much employees work fuels employee performance. When allowed to work with “Radical Flexibility,” the percentage of high-performing workers increased by 19%. Organizations know that demanding their workforces return to the office will exacerbate turnover rates. More than half of employees said their ability to work flexibly would impact whether or not they choose to stay with their current employers.  “Forcing employees into non-flexible work arrangements could leave organizations vulnerable to talent being actively poached by employers offering the kind of flexibility employees have come to expect during the pandemic. Employees have proved they can be productive when remote and are now challenging employers to articulate why they should return,” says Brian Kropp, Chief of HR Research, and Gartner. As of May of 2022, a survey cited in Forbes of human resource leaders from Conference Board, a nonprofit research group, reveals that only 4% of employers are making everyone return to the office. The Conference Board’s research also found that 90% of the surveyed employers are allowing hybrid work schedules, which is in line with the findings from the Harvard Business Review, supporting the existing trend. 2. Well-Being Remains a Top Priority for Employee Retention: Hybrid work schedules and creating human-centric workplaces are some strategies organizations adopt to contribute holistic well-being of staff. Mental, physical, and financial good health continues to be the main driver for employee retention. Flexible hybrid work models give employees more opportunities to strike a work-life balance. They have more time to manage their lives between family, friends, and physical and social activities that support overall well-being. The time savings on commutes and gas, parking, and public transportation costs during sharp increases in inflation give workers the chance to save money. In addition to flexible work environments, creating human-centric workplaces that champion health and reduce human reaction to workplace stress requires more than focusing on health care benefits. Employers must provide self-care opportunities, including wellness or mental health days and paid time off. In the fall of 2021, a Monster report estimated that 1 in 3 people view their job negatively impacting their health and well-being. Mental health days are flexible, impromptu days that employees can utilize to focus on having fun, relieving stress, and preventing burnout. While one or two days might not be enough to address the long-term effects of burnout, employers adding a few days to sick leave or general paid time off days is an excellent way to start. Specifically offering a few days off employees can leverage for wellness or mental health with no questions asked gives your workforce the privacy and freedom to manage self-care productively. Also, employers must communicate to their workforce that mental health days are a part of their paid time off or sick leave. This encourages employees to take a break when needed and helps destigmatize mental health. 3. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Continue to Drive Recruitment and Retention: Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) significantly contributes to employees’ mental well-being. Organizations with a diverse workforce create a sense of belonging for all employees, and it’s critical for recruitment efforts. More than 76% of employees and job seekers (76%) report that a diverse workforce is an essential factor when evaluating companies and job offers, according to Glassdoor. When organizations actively engage their employees, they have a greater sense of belonging. They are less likely to look for opportunities elsewhere. Organizational performance increases, and it’s reflected in company bottom lines. Research shows  A 19% increase in revenue for companies with diverse leadership versus those with below-average leadership diversity, as cited in a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report.  Companies that practiced gender diversity in executive teams outperformed peers by over 20%, from McKinsey &amp; Company.  Inclusive teams increase work by up to 30%, according to Gartner. While transparent companies that invest in DEI outperform organizations that don’t, the latest trend for 2022 reflects the lack of company efforts to support adequate resources to show change or improve diversity within organizations. Organizations committing to DEI are not making it a strategic priority. Less than 15% of organizations have one or more DEI dedicated roles, less than 25% have at least one actual position, and more than 60% don’t have any functions dedicated to DEI, according to Culture Amps 2022 Workplace DEI report. Also, the report indicates that 80% of DEI roles have been created in the last 18 months, suggesting that most companies are just beginning to make DEI a strategic priority. A looming question within the growing trend to increase DEI strategic initiatives is whether or not the latest hybrid work model will bolster organizations’ efforts toward DEI, especially for leaders with limited experience working in genuinely inclusive cultures. A recent McKinsey &amp; Company report shares research that shows how organizations can build DEI efforts for a hybrid workforce with three imperative inclusion practices that leaders should prioritize: work-life support, team building, and mutual respect. 4. Purpose-Driven Employers Gain More Application Traction: Employees seek companies that reflect their values to provide more significant meaning to their work. If your company isn’t communicating its greater purpose beyond its need to churn a profit, you’re likely missing out on A-list talent.  “Employees expect their jobs to bring a meaningful sense of purpose to their lives. 70% of workers need to tie their purpose to work. Employers need to help meet this need or be prepared to lose talent to companies that will,” according to McKinsey and Company research. In LinkedIn’s recently published Purpose: A Practical Guide, purpose-driven organizations see 29% more applicants and 10% more hires. In turn, purpose-driven professionals are 30% more likely to be high performers, have 11% longer tenures, and 47% are more likely to be promoters of their employers. Some of the key takeaways from the guide define purpose as more than the latest buzzword. It defines purpose as the following: The purpose isn’t something to be achieved. It has a broader scope, including a company’s mission, values, and culture. Purpose is more than Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). It’s integrated into every employee’s day-to-day experience and business versus delivered outside the company through a CSR program requiring volunteer work or a certain percentage of time dedicated to a meaningful organization. Purpose doesn’t conflict with wealth creation. Both profits and social impact can co-exist in a purpose-driven organization. Business, rather than government, plays a vital role in solving social and environmental challenges. If you’re looking to define your company’s purpose with deeper meaning, ask the question: why was the company started? You’ll likely find a reason far beyond the need to create profits. 5. Upskilling and Reskilling Opportunities Remain in Demand: A significant threat has been hanging over employers even before the Great Resignation. More than 85 million jobs could go unfilled by 2030 because there aren’t enough skilled people to take them, according to an in-depth Korn Ferry report from 2018. Companies must build a reputation for career development to attract and retain talent in the current and future workforce. A 2022 Pew study found that 63% of workers who quit a job in 2021 did so because of no opportunities for advancement. Learning on the job, versus formal education, helps workers become more upwardly mobile and sets them up for success. Half the skills acquired at work are the average person’s lifetime earnings, McKinsey researchers found. Providing upskilling and reskilling opportunities through eLearning and talent experience platforms can give your workforce an edge.  Upskilling offers employees the chance to improve and advance their skills for growth.  Reskilling allows employees to build new skills for different roles with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Investing in upskilling and reskilling opportunities for your workforce will likely increase performance, spur innovation and keep employees engaged and valued. In turn, your company will likely improve company culture and its external brand to attract and retain talent, as cited in Forbes. 6. AI Leverages Data-Driven Recruitment: Artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and assessment tools continue to evolve and impact recruitment practices. According to a widely cited survey of talent acquisition leaders, 52% say the most challenging part of recruitment is identifying suitable candidates from a large applicant pool. As recruiters prioritize whom to hire, recruitment teams need help with their candidate sourcing and outreach. According to a report cited in Scientific Times, about 37% of businesses have adopted AI to help support decision-making processes, including recruitment. As recruiters focus on locating the right candidate profile for specific roles, improved AI alleviates recruiters from tasks such as: Reviewing resumes to match candidates for particular roles  Conducting reference checks Assessing skills Leveraging chatbots or robots for initial interviewsAlleviated tasks frees-up recruiters to spend more time on human interaction with candidates in the final phases of the hiring process. Also, AI can potentially do a better job of removing unconscious bias among humans regarding diversity and inclusion. According to a study from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in Scientific Times, AI is equal to or better than human hiring, but people react negatively towards it. Questions remain whether or not AI is fair, accurate, or ethical for hiring practices, as explored in a Wall Street Journal, Moving Upstream episode. While AI can improve efficiency with digital hiring best practices, it can never replace the interaction of human contact. In a world where A-list talent is driven to work for human-centric companies and purpose beyond profits drives employer brands, we’ll likely want to connect beyond chatbots. It’s hard to imagine candidates and hiring managers willing to entirely give up human eye-to-eye or verbal communication. People will want to be part of the process to assess human connection and candidates’ soft skills to formulate meaningful working relationships. 7. Alumni Networks Make an Impact: Alumni networks have been a part of corporate cultures for quite some time. But it wasn’t until employees started leaving their organization in droves that the urgency to retain existing staff or entice talent to come back became a high priority. Now alumni program networks are at the top of mind for HR leaders in 2022. Traditionally, the end of an employer and employee relationship can be strange or uncomfortable. But innovative and savvy organizations are re-evaluating their employee’s exits as opportunities to extend relationships for growth versus ending the employer and employee partnership. Alumni networks are a rich resource for recruitment referrals, marketing, and business development opportunities.  “When employees leave a company, they are customers, advocates, and evangelists. The current economic environment has heightened the need for such networks. In many countries, attrition rates and job vacancies are increasing, and companies are facing skills shortages,” according to Emma Sinclair, Co-founder of Enterprise Alumni, from an IMD article. According to the IDC research group, 72% of former employees would return happily to their firm again. These “boomerang” employees reduce the time it takes to fill positions by half. Boomerangs are also 32% more likely to recommend the company to other potential recruits. Citi, one of IDC’s clients, said they source 12% of their annual recruits from their alumni network, with the average cost saving per hire being $75,000. The value Alumni networks can provide organizations is high. For example, a global 500 company that established its program to drive new business reported $400M in alumni-assisted sales in 2019 while also seeing $16M in recruitment cost savings. Another tech company looking to boost their ecosystem and brand exposure reported that their alumni recommend their former organization as a great place to work up to nine times a year. According to a recent McLean &amp; Company report, organization alumni programs tap into a hidden source of personnel for recruitment. For employees who leave:  72% Would return to their previous workplace 24% Regret their Job ChangeFor employees who Leave and Come Back:  44% Hirer Retention Rate 50% Reduction in hiring time 20% Fill external hiresOrganizations recognize that having strong employer advocates in today’s market is more critical than ever. A developed and sustained alumni network conveys to your candidates that employee engagement is valued beyond the employment life cycle, leaving the door open for potential re-employment or contracting opportunities. 8. Talent Experience Platform Adoption Accelerates: Traditional management practices are not keeping up with the technical learning and development needs for the anticipated global workforce shortage expected to arrive sometime between 2025 – 2030 when the generational wave of Baby Boomers retire, leaving a significant skill gap for talent in the workforce.  “We’re not building software for HR anymore–we’re building it for employees,” says Josh Bersin, a global industry HR analyst in HR Executive. This has given rise to what he labels employee experience platforms,” also known as talent experience platforms. Talent Experience Platforms (TXP) drive employee unity and engagement, encompassing content, learning, and analytics.  “Employee experience isn’t just about providing a consumer-grade experience with HR technology,” says Bersin. “It’s also about ensuring employees feel connected to their work and colleagues. In today’s often-fragmented organizations, employees understand the organization’s mission and place in it, and can easily find the information they need for tasks ranging from making benefits choices to furthering their career development”. Organizations use the platform to help guide employees through a merger, find new careers, develop skills in their current employment, and learn more about the company’s benefits offerings. They also use it to help employees understand their role in helping the organization move forward. While it’s hard to know how the rest of 2022 will shake out amongst the latest recruiting trends, there is little doubt that the future of work is hybrid, with new expectations for well-being and better tools to manage the employee journey. The only thing anyone can genuinely ensure is that there will be change. "

            "body": "2022/06/15 - As businesses grapple with new workforce models to balance the desire for flexible work, many remote software developers are trading employed positions for a freelance lifestyle. It’s not only remote developers in the IT and SaaS industries; however, product and project managers, UX designers, marketers, salespeople, and support personnel, are in similar positions as well. But remote work isn’t without challenges. The Wall Street Journal warns recent remote-work trends will force more jobs offshore to higher-skilled workers. To grow and thrive in the digital space, remote software developers must stay fluid in a fast-changing world, continually improve their skills, and maintain accountability and visibility. Here at Esteemed, we can help. We consider ourselves a resource to remote-work software developers. We’ve compiled a list of the following skill sets you may want to develop to cultivate your career. Programming Languages: As you progress in your remote-work software developer career, you’ll naturally want to start showcasing the programming skills where your expertise shines the brightest. With the number of programming languages available to master, it can be challenging to choose which skills to show off. If you’re an experienced developer, your expertise and depth might be broad, so where do you focus? If you’re just starting, you might be wondering, what programming languages will provide you with the best payout? A recent blog post included a list of the top in-demand programming and development skills to master for remote workers and freelancers: · BlockChain and Cryptocurrency Programming · Amazon Web Services (AWS) Development · Mobile App Development · Artificial intelligence (AI) Development · Website Design · Website Development · Data Analysis · Online Security and Ethical Hacking Project Management: Project management is all about time management and scope. If you’re working with a project manager, you’ll want to communicate consistently. Project managers will help you focus solely on the tasks related to product development. They can shield you from managing upper management, clients, and scope creep. But if you find yourself on your own, there are ways you can mitigate the risk of scope creep. Make sure any change requests that deviate from the original project requirements are discussed, agreed upon, and put in writing. If you have to manage changes in scope, which are likely to happen at some point, don’t hesitate to negotiate additional compensation or reallocate hours that stay within the range. Changes could entail providing your client with more resources or pausing the job until the client obtains more budget to compensate your time and energy. Product Management: While many skills overlap between project and product management, there are differences between the two. Project management requires you to manage the details of “How” a project is developed and completed. Product management addresses the “What” and “Why” behind the product’s functionality and features. Product managers focus outward on customer needs and build product roadmaps for stakeholders. They manage the stories behind a product build with a strategic perspective. Here are some skills you’ll want to hone to strengthen your project management abilities. Market research: The ability to conduct market research on your own or work with a market research team is key to understanding your target audience better. You want to thoroughly understand your customer’s pain points, needs, and desired outcomes. Get to know your niche market to create the best market fit for your product. UX best practices: It’s critical to speak the same language as your UX teams to build intuitive, user-friendly, and time-sensitive products. Comprehending UX best practices will provide you with a mutual understanding of how time-consuming tasks may be for your end-users. Strategic thinking: Software developers are natural problem solvers and often prone to strategic thinking. However, presenting yourself as a strategic thinker requires additional thought and communication skills. Be ready to understand the nuances behind problems, find solutions others fail to see and communicate the value in something others might not understand. Stay in tune with the business’s core objectives, which typically include building products that save time and money and solve pain points for customer needs. Sales &amp; Marketing: Learn to sell and close business. For experienced software developers, building an MVP may be the easy part. But if you loathe the idea of sales because it makes you feel queasy, you don’t have to be a pushy opportunist to sign a customer to a contract or project. Selling will come naturally to you if you can hit the following marks: Hold passion for your product and service offering: Be excited about what you’re offering. At the very least, you want to believe that your product is fulfilling a solid need or solving a problem to deliver value continually. Launching and managing a business can be intense. The passion and faith for your offering will keep you motivated and charged when you hit a snag or an obstacle along your journey. Align your minimal viable business (MVB), or product (MVP), with your target market: You want to build an MVP or value proposition before launching your business. Do your research to align your MVP or value prop with your audience. You want to focus on the problems you can solve for your market niche. Consider it an opportunity to practice your product manager skills and think strategically. Invest time setting up a marketing plan: You need to give your business traction to generate opportunities. But if formulating and executing a marketing plan leaves you feeling like a fish out of water, know you’re not alone. Choose one or two marketing strategies and hone in on the marketing channels that are best suited for your products and services. When researching an MVP or service offering, take note of the product benefits and how they differ from competitors. Start formulating a story about why your solutions matter. Soft Skills and Accountability: Continually, soft skills are in high demand for software developers, which are critical to your success and career growth. Soft skills showcase your ability to work well with others. If your work is stellar, but you cannot communicate, collaborate or solve outside of your coding work, your career may suffer. It’s essential to be empathetic. When facing a problem that falls outside your hard-skill repertoire, be open to the gray areas and nuances of the issue. Try to look at a problem from multiple points of view. Don’t be afraid to ask for new perspectives when tackling blockers or improving something. It shows you’re willing to be flexible and open, enabling you to build trust among your peers and managers. Honing your soft skills helps you master accountability, which defines your reputation with integrity, perhaps the most critical soft skill you’ll practice. Well-Being: Well-being remains a focal point for the modern remote workforce. According to MetLife’s recent 20th Annual Benefits Trend Report, 37% of employees report overwhelm and burnout over half the time they are working. Switching to remote work won’t necessarily spare remote software developers from these factors, especially feelings of isolation and disconnectedness. The good news is that well-being is a skill that can be practiced and strengthened to avoid or manage burnout. Fundamentally it’s no different than learning to play an instrument. Exercise, eating a well-balanced diet, getting proper sleep, and socializing are among several tips to help you reach a consistent state of well-being. Networking – Join a Community: Create and maintain a personal network for both support and new opportunities. It will keep you connected to others and contribute to your well-being. A great way to start or expand your connections is to join a talent network. Esteemed Colleagues is a co-working community and Talent Experience Platform developed for digital workers to improve their work-life. It provides avenues to engage, learn, share and manage your life, whether freelancing or working full time for a traditional organization. It can help you thrive through content, events, coaching, and mentoring. The trust you establish within the community will allow you to go beyond your comfort zone to ask questions you might not otherwise. You can find opportunities you won’t find on traditional job sites and create partnerships with others that have the expertise you don’t to complete projects and close new business. Superstar Status: In this world of unlimited demands, constant distraction, and established burnout, mastering anything is an accomplishment. Realistically, acquiring these skills to their fullest can take a lifetime. So take credit for your efforts, stay curious, and be kind to yourself. Esteemed is here to help grow business, manage workplace challenges, and support you through your entire career journey. If nothing else, knowing the attributes associated with this skill list will help you work better with your remote clients and colleagues as you strive toward superstar status and grow your career. "

            "body": "2022/05/02 - Effectively harnessing the disruptive power of today’s technologies can mean the difference between success and failure in a wide variety of industries. Whether it’s artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, or the Internet of Things (IoT), next-generation tech is launching a myriad of startups and calling on CEOs of established companies to adapt and innovate. Key to that innovation is the chief technology officer (CTO)—a leader that has both the strategic vision and practical expertise to build a technology roadmap and guide technical teams. But not every business is suited to a full-time CTO. That’s where the fractional chief technology officer model comes in. This guide explains how the fractional CTO role works, considers the pros and cons, and offers guidance on how to find the best fit for your business-specific needs. What is a Fractional CTO?: A fractional CTO is a seasoned technology pro who, instead of managing all CTO responsibilities, takes on only your most pressing needs—propelling you to your goals quickly and for a fraction of the typical CTO salary. The functions and responsibilities appropriate to the role range from developing technology roadmaps to building strategic partnerships with vendors. The focus can also be on leading internal teams, managing infrastructure, or cybersecurity. The possibilities are endless. Part-Time CTO, Virtual CTO, Interim CTO, and Fractional CTO: What’s the Difference?: A variety of non-traditional CTO models exist today. They sit under the umbrella of chief technology officer-as-a service offerings—filled with the same class of high-caliber technical leaders. Here’s a list of key differentiators:  Part-time CTO—A part-time CTO steps into the “full” CTO role—assuming all responsibilities but performing them in a less than full-time schedule.  Virtual CTO—The virtual CTO is not an in-person employee but instead consults “virtually” by phone or video conference. The contract can be short-term, long-term, or “as needed. ”   Interim CTO—An interim CTO is brought in to close the gap when a full-time CTO leaves an organization or at a key development stage at an early or mid-stage startup. They tend to be less leadership-focused and more technology-focused.   Fractional CTO—The fractional CTO can also be virtual or interim. The key difference is that this role is responsible for your specific set of priorities—nothing more and nothing less. The Rise of the Fractional CTO: The rise of the fractional CTO began in the burning-hot dot com startup environment of the late 1990s. The role is still a great fit for that world but has gained mainstream traction in recent years. It’s becoming more and more common for small and mid-sized companies to bring in a CTO on a fractional basis. The firm may not have the budget to fund a full-time CTO or may only need executive-level technical prowess to take on a particular challenge. Philadelphia-based CTO Nico Westerdale predicts that opportunities for fractional CTOs will grow as the gig economy ethos spreads beyond the service sector. “On a leadership level, the need for fractional CMOs, CFOs, CTOs and a whole host of leaders is increasing,” says Westerdale. “Professionals are finding that they can provide huge value in working on a fractional basis, splitting their time between companies. ” With tech talent in short supply and the adoption of hybrid or remote workplaces, the fractional CTO is poised to become the go-to for growing firms. Pros and Cons of a Fractional CTO: Whether you’re considering bringing in a fractional CTO for a pure tech company or a tech-driven business, you should consider the pros and cons. Advantages of hiring a fractional CTO include:  Saving your business money—The average CTO salary in the U. S. is $255,957. The cost of a fractional CTO can be scaled to your budget.  Reducing time to hire—A CTO search can take six months or more. A fractional CTO can be sourced in hours or days.  Focusing on your greatest need—Hires can be business-focused, tech-focused, or a combination best suited to your immediate goals.  Flexibility—The role can be temporary or long-term, full time or limited hours. The possible disadvantages include:  Difficulties with institutional buy-in—This is a risk if your organization lacks the forward thinking to embrace the fractional CTO model.  Lack of continuity of tech vision—If a smooth hand-off to the next technical leader is not facilitated, the roadmap can be derailed.  Leadership silos—If the fractional CTO is not integrated with the C-suite, technical vision can be compartmentalized.  IP protection—As fractional CTOs move from company to company, it’s important to have proper NDAs in place before you hire. When Is Hiring a Fractional CTO the Right Move?: There are many good reasons to hire a fractional CTO. Here are just a few of them:  Your CTO position is vacant: You might need a highly effective tech leader to step in quickly so that you don’t lose momentum.  Your development team is stumbling: A fractional CTO can step in to get to the root of the problem and take corrective action.  You need to reach a funding or technical milestone: Bring in a heavy hitter to guarantee success.  You need a strategic thinker: If your best developers and technical leads struggle with strategy, a fractional CTO can make the right decisions at the right time. How to Hire a Fractional CTO: Finding top talent can be a challenge in today’s hot job market. There are three tried and true methods for recruiting a fractional CTO. The path you choose depends on your urgency to hire and internal candidate screening resources. 1. In-person networking—Industry events are slowly making a comeback. This option is great if you can vet candidates over a longer timeframe. 2. Job aggregator sites—Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed have broad reach. You’ll need to have a team primed to review applicants. 3. Talent sourcing agencies—If you need highly skilled, pre-screened, ready-to hire fractional CTO candidates, a technical talent sourcing agency is the way to go. It Comes Down to Flexibility and Experience: Technological transformation never comes easy. It requires vision, know-how, and persistence. For startups and established players alike, today’s CTO is often both a tech guru and a strategic planner. The fractional CTO has the flexibility and experience to make change when and where it matters most to your organization. Start Your Fractional CTO Search: Esteemed connects you with pre-vetted fractional CTOs that can tackle your toughest challenges.

            "body": "2022/04/25 - Recruiting leading talent continues to be a problem within tech in 2022. With more open positions than qualified talent, technical recruiting grows even more complicated as the year unfolds. For any organization looking to hire developers, it’s a complex landscape. In this environment, recruiters and employers compete for top talent. At the same time, highly-qualified job seekers have the leverage to choose positions with the strongest incentives: stock options, healthcare, and high pay rates, for example. If you’re constantly struggling to attract, retain, and hire top talent, it could be a sign your tech hiring strategies are no longer working. There are many options a company may consider when recruiting candidates for technical positions: recruiting talent from competing companies or reaching out to colleagues for referrals. However, these approaches may not always produce the desired candidate reach you require. Chances are you might find yourself encountering many of the same candidate profiles as you perform your candidate search. As your explore your options, consider seeking out an already established tech-focused talent pool. A technical recruitment agency with a specialty in finding diverse and pre-screened talent can help you address the biggest challenges tech recruiters face in 2022. Companies hire differently now, and these changes will remain with us into the future. Challenges Recruiters Face in 2022: Demand Is Outpacing Available Tech Talent: Recruiters must find the right talent for open positions. That’s a difficult task when there’s more positions available than qualified talent to fill them. A recent survey from CompTIA found that there were about 4. 9 million tech position openings and almost 400,000 openings in Februrary of 2022. The problem is a shortage of qualified candidates to fill these positions. The US will be short 1. 2 million engineers by 2026, if current trends continue, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There’s no question, the tech talent shortage is a significant issue. Recruiters may need to be more open with what talent they evaluate. They may need to be more willing to evaluate self-taught talent, instead of classically educated developers. The other option is to seek out tech-specific talent networks like Esteemed. Recruiters can find a competitive advantage by finding pre-screened, already-sourced candidates that are part of this network. Screening is Still a Challenge: Maintaining the necessary resources to screen talent is difficult. Let’s consider all that’s involved for a moment. A technical talent screener must be well versed in several complex and technical topics, including appropriate programming languages, disciplines, dev environments, and popular programming tools. A serious candidate’s resume almost always proves their qualifications. Regardless, companies need to do due diligence to ensure this is the case. Otherwise, they are deciding based on the word of the candidate. This can be problematic when you truly don’t know if the candidate is the expert they claim to be. The good news is companies can solve this problem by outsourcing screening-as-a-service. They can ask their candidates to take online coding assessments, augmented screening, technical interviews, and human-reviewed coding tests. They also have detailed actionable reports for recruiters to evaluate. With a great screening program, candidates are properly vetted for the work they are applying for, and recruiters can confidently place their candidates in their roles. Dealing with Competing Offers: Tech candidates are in the driver’s seat when it comes to the offers they consider or accept. Employers that do more to create clear and enticing differentiators within their company do better at attracting top talent. This environment forces companies to become more creative in what they offer to candidates. Several factors might come into play when they make a decision. Some factors candidates may consider before they accept an offer include: interesting problems to solve, salary, flexible hours, company culture, and advancement opportunities. Creating Strong Enough Incentives: Recruiting top technical talent is a competitive challenge. It requires putting together an enticing and comprehensive employment package. This means emphasizing workplace culture and benefits. You are working to draw the attention of top-level talent. For full-time developer positions this might mean perks like: the ability to work on attractive projects, the ability to work remote, flexible hours, and a competitive salary. Incentives to contract developers may take more creativity. But some ideas might include: gift cards, virtual courses, or a bonus. Companies need to consider the independent factors a candidate might consider. We often look at branding as a marketing objective. These factors are the part of your brand, however, which a potential hire will see. A robust social media presence with posts that clearly convey the company culture or talk about client projects will look good to candidates. That’s critical when you’re trying to position your company as attractive to work for. Recruiter and Hiring Manager Misalignment: Talent recruitment and hiring managers must work together. Hiring managers might paint an unrealistic picture of the ideal candidate. For example, they might want a front-end and back-end developer with experience in emerging technologies that have only been around for a few years. This can make the position challenging to fill. A general skill set may still work in some circumstances, even when the job is specialized. It’s important to understand when two, five, or ten years of experience may be necessary for the role. When the hiring manager and recruitment have the same ideal candidate in mind, it becomes easier to fill the position. Recruiting Against the Clock: In the current competitive hiring landscape, recruiters are forced to work in accelerated conditions. As candidates receive multiple offers on LinkedIn and in their inbox, they grow impatient with slow recruitment processes. At any time during the hiring search, a candidate might choose to work with whichever company is faster to close the position, creating even more pressure for organizations to act fast during the recruitment process. When candidates drive the process, technical recruiters must collect precise candidate data faster than their competitors. One option is to screen candidates to better understand the talent. Understanding their skill level and programming knowledge early in the process can save you significant time. You can either do this internally or outsource it. Making sure that your technical recruiters have the appropriate background to fill the position can also help you speed the process and help you hire the right candidate. Slow These Challenges by Reducing Your Turnover Rate: The tech industry experiences the highest turnover rates of any business sector at 13. 2 percent. Intense competition, lack of growth, and company culture all play a part in the churn. Your company can buck that trend by managing the challenges above. This will slow down the need to constantly recruit talent. When you can attract and retain top talent, you can succeed into the future. Finding the Top Tech Talent in a Competitive Environment: Talent sourcing allows companies to bypass these common hiring challenges. It concentrates highly qualified technical talent into a single network. This allows you to connect with highly skilled professionals and build lasting professional relationships. You can nurture your talent network and turn candidates into promising job applicants. With this approach you’ll be able to future proof your workforce, pursue talent from a wider demographic, and speed up candidate searches. You can gain full access to qualified professionals in hard-to-hire specialties. Talent sourcing is your chance to create a full funnel of highly talented applicants.

            "body": "2022/04/01 - Whether first-hand or through the experiences of others, the past two years have demonstrated that teams can be just as effective working remotely as working in person. However, this doesn’t mean that you should be losing out on the benefits of some of the more traditional office activities ⁠— like team retreats. Team retreats provide the opportunity for your company to get together, talk business, socialize, and have fun outside of the usual work environment. Data shows that talented, loyal employees want benefits ⁠— beyond free coffee and paid delivery lunches. A team retreat in a desirable location is just one way to incentivize your hard-working employees. In fact, with remote work and hybrid arrangements now the norm across the workplace, team retreats have become a necessity. Work is built on relationships, and investing in those relationships is a proven strategy to improve collaboration within your organization. So, if you’re considering hosting a remote team retreat, make sure you’re set up for success. 1. Survey Your Team: To start, it’s important to understand your team’s thoughts about the possibility of a remote retreat. Some may have busy schedules, and others might be uncomfortable with the concept of overnight business travel. It’s also worth checking in with your contract employees and extending the same benefits to them. Surveying your team, however, isn’t just about gaining their initial impressions. Lead by example and demonstrate that your employees have a say in the decision-making process. Your survey should gather information on desired destinations and which part of the year they are available. In many cases, a dedicated remote team retreat partner can even help you during these initial stages to organize and analyze feedback from your team. 2. Consider Your Company Goals: After surveying your team and making your decision, plan your team retreat with your company goals in mind. As you plan, you might work with your leadership team to determine which areas you’d like to focus on. Are you looking to cultivate more community and culture within your teams? Do you hope to focus on the business and inspire your employees to meet their KPIs? Or, are you simply rewarding your employees for their efforts over the past year? While every remote team retreat will combine multiple goals, deciding which objectives you’d like to focus on while planning your retreat will help you narrow down the location, activities, and overall experience of the event. 3. Identify a Location: In choosing your location for your remote team retreat, you’ll need to strike a balance. It’s essential to find a location that offers ample space to create a comfortable and social atmosphere that encourages a combination of relaxation and productivity. Is your team willing to travel? Would you prefer something local? A remote location far from the stress of the workplace (or even something to pull people out of their daily routine) can facilitate mental changes across your organization. There are many companies that have curated experiences across worldwide locations. If you decide to choose a remote team retreat partner, make sure that they have established spaces for retreat activities and a history of executing successful team retreats. 4. Reserve Lodging: Wherever you plan your retreat, your team will need lodging – be it house rentals, hotel rooms, or other overnight arrangements. If your lodging isn’t the same as your retreat location, confirm that your retreat center is nearby. You won’t want your employees to feel like they’re commuting, especially on a remote retreat. Find a location that can accommodate all of your team and also offer benefits. If you’re able, book a space that embraces a coworking mentality so your employees can network with other remote workers and develop lasting relationships. Once you’ve found this, set a budget and book! Now you can focus on planning the events. 5. Choose a Catering Provider: Food, like location, is one of the major motivators behind any retreat. If you’ve decided on an overseas retreat, plan on sampling the local fare. This will give your employees and team members the opportunity to experience some of the culture on location. Check local listings on TripAdvisor or Google to discover restaurants that accept large volume preorders, or choose a dedicated caterer to work with your team within your retreat venue. As you’re exploring your options, determine which meals you’ll serve to your participants. Only breakfast and lunch? Only lunch and dinner? All three? While you’re planning, you may also want to give your team members the option of going out on their own or with others to explore local fare. No matter which option you choose, ensure that all dietary restrictions and allergy needs are met. Doing so will help keep morale strong within your organization and demonstrate that you care about the (very literal) health of your employees. 6. Find Group Facilitators: During a remote team retreat, organizers and executive leadership should be equal participants in the activities. By having group facilitators present at your event, not only will the executive leadership team benefit from many of the activities on the agenda, but also be on the same footing as everyone else in the company. Presenting your executive team in this way can have many benefits for both senior management and employees. Workers may be able to bond with leadership in a way they haven’t been able to during hectic day-to-day routines, and leadership can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for their employees’ different personalities and perspectives. Additionally, group facilitators can also hold discussions or mediate conversations on difficult topics, providing a neutral presence at your retreat that can help facilitate better cross-team dialogue and communication. 7. Design Team-Building Activities: Not surprisingly, activities in a team retreat should appeal to a broad range of people. As the retreat planner, be sure to plan these activities after deciding on the goals of the retreat. Additionally, consider whether or not the venue will suit the types of events you’d like to host. Some venues include team-building activities in their programs, which can help reduce costs overall. Most importantly, during the events, your retreat participants should feel challenged but not isolated. This is a delicate exercise and requires knowledge of your team’s personalities and preferences. When planning events, consider the following as a starting point:  Hire dedicated presenters in your company’s field of expertise Find a motivational speaker who is relatable to your employees Plan creative events like cooking classes, painting, or yoga Split into teams and play physical sports or mental strategy games Seek out mindfulness practitioners to facilitate meditation sessionsUnfortunately, you can’t please everyone, even at a team retreat. But by offering a range of activities, your employees will walk away feeling as if they have learned something and bonded with their team members. 8. Learn With the Locals: If you choose to have a remote team retreat in a foreign country (or even a part of the city your company is not familiar with), it’s helpful to foster relationships with local communities to gain insider knowledge about the area. Wherever you choose to hold your team retreat, make sure to network with locals or long-term visitors to gain initial impressions and trusted recommendations for any services you and your team may need. Look into teaming up with WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups, or even connections through your own networks to build out local events that will leave a lasting impression in your team’s mind. Obviously, there are many ways to plan and host a team retreat. With such an investment in your team at stake, it’s not always easy to decide how to proceed when first exploring your options. A dedicated team retreat partner can help alleviate some of the pressures or anxieties around planning and executing.

            "body": "2022/03/11 - Chief technology officers (CTOs) are key members of the executive team who provide leadership, direction, and expertise to technical teams. This is true whether you’re a 10-person start up, an established SMB, or a large enterprise. A fractional CTO offers the same industry-specific knowledge as a full-time CTO—with trimmed responsibilities and at a lower cost. Before you move to bring in a fractional chief technical officer, it’s important to understand the benefits, assess your needs, and make sure your remote hiring practices are up to par. We’ll cover those considerations and discuss three ways to find the right technical leader. Why Hire a Fractional CTO over a Full-Time CTO?: A full-time CTO takes responsibility for aligning a company’s technology resources and vision with its business goals. That can include setting technical direction, leading developers and engineers, and collaborating with other C-suite executives to move short-and long-term goals forward. A fractional chief technology officer is tasked with specific, urgent needs such as strategic planning, infrastructure management, or product development. Fractional CTOs are seasoned pros, so they’ll be able to quickly tackle business priorities. They’ll also save you money. Full-time CTOs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Hiring fractional CTO will reduce costs without sacrificing outcomes. What Can a Fractional CTO Do for Your Business?: A fractional CTO can help you reach almost any goal. They concentrate their efforts where you need them most. Some ways they can bring value to your organization include: · Delivering a technical roadmap and strategy · Launching new products or services · Guiding technical teams to prioritize work and tighten schedules · Overseeing IT security · Managing technology contracts What Are the Key Skills You Need in a Fractional CTO?: Defining the skill set you need in a fractional CTO can make or break your hire. What are the broad qualifications you are seeking? Is start up experience a deal-breaker? Are there experience or skill gaps with your current team that you need to fill? Is an advanced degree preferred? What about hard and soft skills? Are you seeking specific technical or strategic knowledge? Is crisis management or communication at the top of your list? Your search stands the best chance for success with these details laid out in advance. Are Your Remote Hiring Practices Attracting the Best?: The demand for top technical talent is outpacing the current supply. That’s why it’s critical that you evaluate your hiring process to make sure it’s smooth and transparent to attract the best candidates. Your HR team should know how to evaluate technical executives. They must clearly and accurately articulate the responsibilities of the position and understand how it interacts with the C-suite. If you’re not confident your team is up to the task, consider using an agency that specializes in the recruitment of fractional executives. 3 Ways to Source a Fractional CTO: Now that you have a clear picture of what you’re looking for in a fractional CTO, it’s time to look at the three ways to recruit one. 1. In-person networking—Pounding the pavement at industry events can lead you to candidates. More opportunities will become available as the pandemic eases. 2. Job aggregator sites—Posting the role on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed will give it wide exposure and could lead to many applications. Before you try it, consider if you have the needed resources for screening. 3.

            "body": "2022/03/07 - Selecting the right technical screening methods to properly assess the skill and experience level of job applicants during the hiring process can help to distinguish between Junior developers and Senior developers. It’s important to understand the job description and requirements for the role you need to fill, so you don’t try to hire an under-qualified Junior for a Senior role, or expect a Senior to work for a Junior pay rate. Senior level talent is the foundation for any development team and can be a leading factor in the level of success your development team sees. Junior level talent is often filled with potential and promise and can be trainable to meet your goals and objectives. The screening process helps to distinguish each candidate’s level, and how they might be able to help your organization. Below is a list of popular screening methods for developers, and how they might help you to find the right candidate for your development team. When it comes to filling the position, it helps to know what you’re looking for. But first, it may be helpful to discuss a little more about the technical attributes that differentiate a Junior developer and a Senior developer. The Technical Attributes of a Junior Developer: Junior developers may not have proven themselves capable of working independently within the context of a team yet. They may bring a fresh energy to their work, but at the same time will likely need some supervision and guidance. Their presence can increase in value over the long run, as they gain experience and evolve in their careers. Here are some signs of technical expertise to look for in the screening of Junior developers:  Coding knowledge (illustrated through a degree, bootcamp, work experience, or coding challenges).  A proven ability to problem-solve and be resourceful.  Some level of hands-on experience.  Familiarity with your company’s core technology stack. The Technical Attributes of a Senior Developer: Senior developers can work independently or as a collaborative member of the team. Whether or not they take a leadership role, they do not require close supervision. They have a firm grasp of the big picture and how their role fits into it. Beyond their technical skill set, Senior developers should also have the soft skills to collaborate with others and should be willing to mentor colleagues of all experience levels. Here are some signs of technical expertise for Senior developers:  The ability to work end-to-end through a software development lifecycle.  The ability to preemptively account for any potential issues or errors within their work.  A willingness to keep learning through industry blogs, podcasts, books, or other informational sources.  The ability to project-manage with minimal guidance on an individual or team level.  The ability to accurately determine project scope and deliver on time. The Best Technical Screening Methods for Junior vs. Senior Developers in 2022: Screening and evaluating candidates with the following methods in mind can help you find developers that are right for your organization. To help you use this resource, the methods below are broken down into different sections: Experience Verification, Identity Verification, Skills Verification, and Screening Interviews. Remember, the best tools and methods will vary from organization to organization. Experience Verification: 1. Resume Screening – There is a reason resumes are still a mainstay in any hiring process. They offer employers a clear view of experience and qualifications. The drawback to using resumes in the screening process is time. When you’re staring at a pile of hundreds, if not thousands of resumes, it can be a daunting task to filter through all of them for the most qualified candidates. A professional screening service can help to reduce this burden by pre-screening candidates and sending only the best-suited applicants to your hiring team for review. 2. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) – Many screening services rely on technology to automate the resume scanning process by using AI to filter large volumes of resumes based on keywords. This certainly helps them to turn the crank and make the sausage, but it’s hardly a guarantee of quality. In fact, applicants have figured out how to fool this software by formatting their resumes to contain dozens of these keywords in invisible text. Unscrupulous candidates may simply copy the resume of a more experienced developer and slap their name across the top, or even steal the other coder’s identity outright. 3. Public Profiles – Social media profiles such as LinkedIn can give significant clues about a candidate’s professional background and skill set. A LinkedIn profile can be cross-referenced with a resume to find out more. There are also places within a LinkedIn profile for candidates to display references, testimonials, and samples of previous work. All of this applicant data helps in screening Senior vs. Junior developers. If your open position is a Drupal role, it’s worth checking for profiles at Drupal. org. Those profiles should have project links where applicable, and link to a portfolio. Moreover, Drupal. org profiles also keep track of community contributions, including participation in issue queues (bug reports and patches), edits to documentation, code contributions merged into core or community-contributed projects, and modules or themes released to the public. While it’s entirely possible to find Senior developers whose profiles don’t have much activity (some people only code during work hours or are prohibited from open-sourcing client code), it’s rare to find profiles with a lot of activity that aren’t backed up by the skills. A quick check on Facebook and other less professional-oriented platforms can also provide telling information. These social media sites can help to determine whether a candidate will provide the right type of cultural fit within your organization. There shouldn’t be any questionable or offensive content in any public profile. When conducting Experience Verification, differentiating between Junior and Senior developers requires more than simply counting years of experience. Senior experience should include roles with more responsibility, whether leading a team, taking charge of a key element of a project, or completing entire projects as a solo developer. Senior projects tend to be more complex, and project scope should be more ambitious. With Juniors, be on the lookout for steady roles in smaller projects, or supporting roles in larger projects. Identity Verification: 4. Reference Checking – Reference checks are another classic way to screen any new hire. Understanding how they performed with previous hires will go a long way in assessing both Junior and Senior developers. It’s also important to verify that inexperienced developers are not making up job experiences to try and pass themselves off as Senior developers. 5. Online Research – A simple Google search can offer a lot of different types of information on a candidate. If there is a website, public portfolio, or a strong social media presence, this is how an employer may find it. The clues left behind here can be used to assess a developer’s skill set and what role they might fill within your organization. When conducting Identity Verification, be on the lookout for evidence to corroborate job history and projects listed on resume. Senior developers should have well-documented work experiences, and may even have a short bio on the “About” page of their most recent employer’s website. Juniors should be able to describe their job experiences in convincing detail, including their role in a project and the technologies used; they should be able to produce references upon request. Skills Verification: 6. Project Links – It’s increasingly common for developers to have a Portfolio Website with a selection of Project Links (quite simply, links to a candidate’s professional work that is published on the public Internet). It’s not always possible to assess a candidate’s skill set by simply viewing a website, but screeners can use browser tools to inspect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sources to determine the tech stack and third-party services used in the project. In some cases, a project may not have a Project Link: if it is not public-facing (it’s on a client’s private network and requires VPN access, or something else), or not a website (it’s a mobile or desktop app, or something else), or not online any more (but may be archived at web. archive. org). Candidates who cannot share URLs to their recent work will benefit from collecting their experiences in a portfolio website with a gallery containing screenshots and descriptions of the work they did on the project. Even if they don’t have a portfolio website, candidates should be prepared to share Client Websites, Demo Apps, or both. A Senior developer should have Client Websites that they can share. (Sometimes a Senior developer will have only one URL to share, because they have been working at one company for many years. ) Junior developers may not have client work to show yet, but they can share Demo Apps that are published online. The best Demo Apps will double as a Code Sample, providing their source code in a public git repository. 7. Code Samples – Reviewers should not expect candidates to share source code from client work, especially if doing so would violate a non-disclosure agreement. The flip side of this restriction is that candidates should expect to provide a code sample that is either released under an Open Source software license or in the public domain. A good Code Sample provides evidence that the developer can write their own code (not based on code from an open source project, or created using a code generator). The code sample does not have to be fancy, but it does need to implement custom business logic (i. e. , “do something”) by following the coding standards, best practices, and security recommendations of the platform. The best Code Samples will double as a Demo App, linking to a live demo on the web. Senior developers should have no trouble sharing a Code Sample, but Junior developers may need to be assigned a Coding Challenge. 8. Coding Challenges – A short coding task for candidates to complete, either in person or remotely, can help a hiring manager to determine the right candidate for the position based on their ability to perform the work that will be expected from them. The reality is that it’s hard to assess a developer’s ability through interviews alone. Skills assessments such as coding challenges can make it easier to determine a candidate’s skill level. There are various types of coding challenges that can help you to distinguish between a Junior and Senior developer, and make the right selection for your organization. Some of these include:  Algorithm Challenges – These bite-sized coding challenges can be completed quickly, and sometimes graded automatically. Generally, these are an adequate test of coding style and logical thinking skills, but they may not show a candidate’s ability to code to platform-specific APIs.  Take-home Challenges – The developer candidate can complete these on their own time, sometimes overnight or over a weekend. These challenges, often based on real-world scenarios, allow screeners to evaluate a candidate’s ability to follow coding standards and best practices of platform-specific APIs.  Pair Programming – This is a coding challenge that you and the candidate solve together. It’s probably a better option for hiring a Senior developer that may not be overwhelmed with the task of a live challenge.  Whiteboarding – The candidate would solve this type of coding challenge live and in front of the hiring team. This is better at determining how a candidate handles stress than their actual coding abilities. Algorithm challenges are quick and easy, and may be included in automated skills testing. Take-home challenges require more time to evaluate, so it does not make sense to require everyone to complete these; they are typically reserved for candidates who have already passed automated skills testing. Pair Programming and Whiteboarding require a significant investment of time and effort from the hiring team as well as the job applicant, so they are best reserved for developers who have already passed earlier rounds of screening. Senior developers generally write clean, concise, well-structured code. They follow coding standards such as adding doc blocks to all classes and methods, but they don’t clutter up their code with irrelevant comments. They anticipate unexpected inputs, throwing and catching exceptions correctly. They strive to produce elegant, minimal, testable, and maintainable code. Junior developers often write code that works in a given scenario, but may not be flexible enough to catch exceptions from edge cases and unexpected inputs. They seldom follow all coding standards, and their inline comments may be chatty and redundant. They may repeat themselves or hard-code values that should be configurable. Still, if they are able to get the job done and write code that works, they may be ready to join your team and gain experience. Take a look here if you’re looking for more information on how to get started with coding challenges. 9. Skills Testing – Many screening services offer skills assessments, which may combine algorithm challenges, multiple choice quizzes and other elements. Sometimes, these assessments may be evaluated automatically by software. Automated tests can efficiently screen huge numbers of candidates in the least amount of time, but run the risk of producing false negative results that can eliminate qualified candidates. The best screening services will ensure that each candidate is reviewed by a human expert, preferably even before skills testing assessment is assigned. After evaluating Resumes, Public Profiles, Project Links and Code Samples, expert screeners are able to assign an appropriate assessment that tests the skills needed for Junior or Senior roles. 10. Community Contributions – If the candidate has made any contribution to open-source projects, this can be a great place to find examples of their work. Community Contributions may come in the form of bug reports, code patches, documentation, or questions and answers in community forums. Senior developers are more likely to contribute code patches that fix bugs, while Junior developers are more likely to submit bug reports. 11. Answering Questions on Forums – Community forums such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Quora can give a potential employer deeper insight into a candidate’s experience and skill level. It’s important to look at the nature of the questions, and the depth of the answer to determine the level of thought that the candidate put into their answer. Senior developers are more likely to be the ones who answer questions and solve problems, while Junior developers are more likely to ask questions. Screening Interviews: 12. Video Interview – Video interviews have been an interview staple since 2020 and allow employers and candidates to get face to face without needing to be present within the same room. There are several programs that make this option easier than ever. Here are just a few popular video meeting platforms:  Zoom Skype Microsoft Teams Google MeetAs the interviewer, you can pay attention to the same factors that you would if the candidate were sharing the room with you. You’ll want to have a list of questions prepared for the candidate to work through. This is the framework for the structure of the interview. Body language can give you a good idea of the confidence level of the candidate. It’s important to keep in mind that some may be nervous in a job interview environment, and that could impact their body language. Another factor to watch for in a video interview that wouldn’t factor for an in-person interview is the environment. A neutral background with no distractions is a great way to maintain a professional look. It should be clear that the candidate has considered the lighting as well. The interviewer should be able to get valuable information from both Junior and Senior developers through a video interview, the way they would in person. Both levels should convey a high level of confidence and professionalism through the interview, but a Senior developer should carry themselves with more confidence. A good list of technical screening questions is important for this method. 13. Asynchronous Video Interview – An asynchronous, or one-way, video interview is an excellent way to quickly assess candidates early on in a job interview process. Candidates love them because they are typically short, and most offer unlimited re-records for those who may be nervous about the quality of their answer, or appearance on video. Employers see a benefit from being able to assess a candidate early in the process, by their answer to a select 2-3 important questions. There’s no need to schedule interviews, and you can watch the videos at your convenience. 14. Other Interviews (Phone, Slack, LinkedIn, etc. ) – Sometimes it is quicker and easier to do a screening interview over the phone, or via text messages. Slack or LinkedIn can also be used for this purpose. It can be easier to schedule and a less formal process when a candidate isn’t overly concerned about environmental factors or personal appearance, like they would be with video interviews. Like with video interviews, detailed and thoughtful questions can be used to assess the skill level of the candidate. One word of caution: if you don’t do a video interview, you run a greater risk of being fooled by a fake candidate. 15. Screening as a Service – If you’re short on time or feel like you don’t have the experience or resources, there’s another solution available. You can hire a company that provides screening as a service, such as Esteemed. When you go this route, you can be confident that you’ll have a technical screener with the background and experience to be able to properly evaluate talent. You’ll also have a large pool of pre-qualified candidates to choose from. The State of Developer Candidate Screening in 2022: Screening developer candidates has become more complex in a remote work environment, but it’s still possible to do it well. Each company will have its own projects, and each role will have its own requirements. Clearly identifying the requirements for your open role should always be your first step. After you’ve posted the job description and the applicants start flooding in, you’ll need every tool available to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Skills Verification methods, such as skills testing, code review, and coding challenges, ensure that you consider only applicants whose skills fit perfectly into this new role on your team.  Experience Verification methods, such as review of resumes and public profiles, ensure that your top picks are neither over-qualified for a Junior role, nor under-qualified for a Senior role.  Identity Verification methods protect you from scammers, fake candidates, and identity thieves.  Screening Interviews give you the opportunity to evaluate applicants in real-time, to determine whether they actually possess the knowledge they claim or are just good at bluffing. Evaluate All Your Screening Options: Some of these screening techniques can be quite complex, labor-intensive, and time-consuming – especially if your hiring team lacks the relevant technical expertise. Cutting corners can mean throwing the ideal candidate’s resume in the trash before a human being can evaluate it, or getting tricked into hiring the wrong person. Luckily, you don’t have to screen developer candidates on your own. An experienced tech recruitment agency like Esteemed can help you to find a pool of experienced, pre-screened candidates to meet your qualifications and needs, with our screening services. Outsourcing your screening frees you from worries about the tech talent shortage and simplifies the entire hiring process. "

            "body": "2022/01/28 - The IBM Institute for Business Value published a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) study in late 2021 to summarize the role’s evolution “throughout a period of exceptional disruption. ” IBM states that “the CTO has become one of the most strategic roles within an organization [and is] aligned to lead a new ‘Virtual Enterprise’ model […] fueled by a fresh post-digital approach to business opportunity. ” As Moises Nascimento, CTO for Banco Itaú, so aptly puts it: “When everything becomes digital, technology becomes the core business and the CTO becomes as key as the CEO. ” What Benefits Do CTOs Provide?: CTOs are responsible for managing an organization’s technology, science, and engineering efforts. They wear many hats, though their greatest benefits lie in their leadership and organizational skills. For companies with a dedicated in-house tech team (or a reliance on freelance developers and IT staff), a CTO acts as the liaison between senior management, department heads, and tech talent. The CTO is responsible for aligning the company’s goals with its technology resources. Businesses that are looking to flesh out their technology strategies and create actionable implementation plans will turn to a CTO to oversee the process. CTOs bring cohesion, communication, and leadership to the technologies that power a company’s products and services. As with so many senior level roles, the expertise, professional background, and focus areas differ in scope. Take, for example, a 2021 CTO survey which reported that 7 out of 10 CTOs previously held the role of software developer or engineer – but that tech leads, project managers, DevOps administrators, and academics all produced CTOs, too. Typically, CTO roles are filled either by a co-founder (if the organization is a start-up) or by joining the company as a result of a direct hire. In a global study, only about 31 percent of CTOs reported that they transitioned to their role from within the business. Leadership and Management: CTOs are responsible for ensuring that their tech team operates at the highest level. Their leadership (and motivation) is critical for keeping developers and other IT professionals happy, especially when you consider the turnover rate for top tech talent. If your organization has an IT department or an in-house tech team, but doesn’t have a CTO, a fractional CTO is a great way to lead your team and retain your hard-won talent without having to add a full-time role. And, if the past few years have taught us anything, it’s that relationships can remain strong, even if they’re primarily conducted remotely. Hiring a fractional CTO to assist your team on a part-time, virtual basis doesn’t mean you’re compromising on the human element. Great leaders adapt – and CTOs are great with technology. What Does a Fractional CTO Do Differently?: A fractional CTO is hired to work a fraction of the hours a traditional CTO would work. As a result, they essentially cherry-pick the most important tasks, projects, and responsibilities. You’ll find that some organizations refer to the role of a fractional CTO by different names:  Part-Time CTO Virtual CTO On-Demand CTO Outsourced CTONote: If you’re looking for an in-depth explainer on what a fractional CTO is, we’ve put together an easily-digestible resource here. Fractional CTOs have the same level of education, the same depth of experience, and the same skill set as their full-time counterparts. Where they differ, however, is in their exposure to technologies, projects, and teams. Full-Time CTO vs. Fractional CTO: Full-time CTOs have the benefit of spending years at a single company, working with the same developers, overseeing the entire lifecycle of products and projects, and creating deep relationships between their team, their tech, and their business goals. Fractional CTOs offer something else entirely. Because they work with companies on-demand, by project, or on a limited scale, they’re constantly exposing themselves to new things. Fractional CTOs are highly adaptable, quick to onboard, and understand what (and how) to prioritize. Innovation, Exposure, and the Evolution of Leaders: “To be successful today,” argues Jonathan Naymark, General Manager of Codecademy for Business, “employees will need to learn new skills throughout their entire career trajectories[. ]” The nature of a fractional CTO position is one of high growth and new experiences, and thus facilitates a culture of continuous learning. If your company hires a fractional CTO, you’re not only gaining a seasoned professional, but you’re investing in your internal employees’ professional growth. A fractional CTO’s leadership will inspire your team, provide them with new insight, increase engagement, and ultimately help with retention. How Can Fractional CTOs Help Your Business?: Fractional CTOs can help your organization by taking on any responsibility you would otherwise ask of a full-time CTO. They’ll design and execute your technology strategies, manage your IT team, serve on executive committees, and present reports. They’ll also make critical business decisions – backed by CTO industry trends and time-honored methods. Focusing on Cybersecurity: Fractional CTOs play a critical role in managing risk and protecting your company’s data. If you don’t currently have a dedicated team to provide your organization with security sources, you’re not alone. One report shows that 42 percent of CTOs work for organizations with no cybersecurity at all. Luckily, this is an easy fix. Cybersecurity can be outsourced, and you can employ a fractional CTO whose primary focus is IT security. Because a fractional CTO works on a fraction of the whole, you have the freedom to choose which areas of your business need the most attention. For many, it’s cybersecurity. Leveraging AI: If your business wishes to dedicate resources to AI, you’ll have greater flexibility in hiring a fractional CTO than in finding a full-time officer with AI experience and availability. In 2021, the global AI market exceeded $327. 5 billion – despite the fact that the majority of CTOs don’t have a team or department to devote to the growing cause. To compete in this area, then, you can take a shortcut. Rather than build out a separate AI division, for example, find a fractional CTO with AI experience who can lead your team. Fractional CTOs are great because they have greater exposure to different industries, focus areas, tech teams, and projects – simply by nature of their job. “The implementation of AI in many companies is still in its early stages,” says Lukasz Grzybowski, Head of Machine Learning and Data Engineering at Stx Next. However, interest in AI and deep learning is exploding, “in particular when it comes to [their] application in natural language processing, natural language, understanding, chatbots, and computer vision. ” What Does It All Mean?: The future, therefore, lies with CTOs with the flexibility, experience, and insight needed to remain unflappable in the face of unconventional work. Fractional CTOs, by definition, are unconventional. This role is unorthodox – it takes a traditional, full-time, 9-to-5 position and turns it on its head. Fractional CTOs get greater exposure to more organizations, more teams, more talent, and more projects than if they remained at a single company for the entirety of their career. Your business benefits from this, and by teaming up with a fractional CTO, you’re positioning your organization to adapt to emerging technologies like AI, for example. Hiring For the Future: AI, cloud computing, and big data analytics may be the biggest technology challenges that your company will need to overcome in the immediate future, but technology trends emerge at an incredible pace. If you’re interested in seeing how a fractional CTO can boost your business and provide critical stability and leadership, we’re here to help. "

            "body": "2022/01/21 - If you’re actively growing your organization, and if your business has a technical side that requires management, you need a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). That’s an easy call. But who to hire, and how to hire? These are trickier questions. Not only is there a rapidly growing global tech talent shortage, worsened by the increased reliance on technology in response to the pandemic, but there is heightened competition for CTOs that pits mega-conglomerates against start-ups. Take, for example, the average salary of a CTO in the United States: $254,308. Depending upon location, education, and experience, that number can easily exceed $300,000, a salary more readily paid by established corporations than SMBs and new ventures. If a full-time CTO isn’t the best fit for your organization, what are the possible alternatives? Some choose to hire a part-time CTO, others place an interim tech officer in the position, and many businesses are turning to a unique resource – the fractional CTO. What is a Fractional CTO?: A “traditional” CTO – the senior executive holding a full-time role within a company – is tasked with managing all technological requirements of their organization. To remain competitive in today’s digital landscape, where the pace of technological change across business and society is astronomical, companies need a dedicated resource who can lead strategic direction and efficiently manage technology. There is, however, a range of options an organization can choose from when it comes to filling the role of a CTO. In addition to a full-time CTO, you’ll find several other terms to describe available resources:  Part-Time CTO Interim CTO Virtual CTO On-Demand CTO Fractional CTOEach title describes an individual with an advanced level of skills and experience well-suited to the task of managing a company’s technology. They overlap in many ways, but they also vary in their scope and availability. Let’s take a look at several ways in which these roles differ: Full-Time CTO vs. Fractional CTOUnlike a full-time CTO, a fractional CTO focuses their efforts on specific areas of your business and is, therefore, responsible for managing a fraction of a full-time CTO’s responsibilities. Part-Time CTO vs. Fractional CTOA fractional CTO oversees a limited number of activities, issues, and business needs, whereas a part-time CTO is responsible for all technology-related needs in a limited capacity (part-time). Interim CTO vs. Fractional CTOAn interim CTO is a position meant for transitioning responsibilities from one person to another. A fractional CTO can step into the role of an outgoing employee, but they are not used exclusively as a temporary solution to an unfilled position. So, what is a fractional CTO? A fractional CTO is defined as a CTO who manages technology for a company “for a fraction of the time, on a fraction of the projects, and for a fraction of the cost,” compared to their traditional full-time counterpart. There’s no distinction between education level, years of experience, or any other skill – the only difference is that a fractional CTO is essentially an on-demand consultant for specific projects, plans, or technologies. Tech professionals predict that an already increased demand for fractional CTOs will continue to accelerate. “Professionals are finding that they can provide huge value in working on a fractional basis,” says fractional CTO Nico Westerdale. “For growing businesses, this […] keeps costs significantly lower than a full-time hire, but can bring in targeted expertise they need. ” If you don’t have a CTO, but you do have a vision, hiring a fractional CTO is a great way in which to manage technology direction at a fraction of a full-time salary. What Does a Fractional CTO Do?: There are a host of functions and responsibilities that a fractional CTO takes on, and they generally vary by the company’s industry, size, and maturity. “While fractional CTOs are usually associated with startups,” argues tech journalist Erika Morphy, “there has been a change in thinking in recent years about the value that a [fractional] CTO can add and now even larger companies are embracing their use. ” Fractional CTOs typically involve themselves in both the technical aspect (collaborating with developers, overseeing IT maintenance, etc. ) and with business development. Sometimes, a fractional CTO will focus exclusively on technology matters. These executives are actively involved in decision-making and play a critical role in connecting upper management with tech teams. A fractional CTO oversees a multitude of responsibilities, including daily operations, cybersecurity efforts, technology contracts, routine maintenance, crisis management, technology contract management, product strategy, and growth planning. Essentially, they’re responsible for designing your company’s tech strategy, overseeing its launch, adjusting the strategy as needed, and looking for ways in which to optimize technical operations on an ongoing basis. Typical responsibilities of a fractional CTO may include:  Establishing a solid technology strategy Ensuring the right technologies are being utilized Mapping out ways in which technology can further the company’s goals Creating and managing product roadmaps Overseeing technology developments and internal IT operations Problem-solving for developers and other IT team members Making sure technology is properly distributed to external customers and clients Managing strategic partnerships with technology vendors Building a scalable product Supervising in-house and/or outsourced IT professionalsA fractional CTO may be asked to focus on a specific role or responsibility. For example, a company might hire a fractional CTO to act as a strategic planner. This individual would prioritize finding the most suitable technologies for the company and creating a technical strategy to lay foundations. Another organization might bring on a fractional CTO specifically to manage infrastructure. Focusing on this, the CTO would be tasked with overseeing data, networks, maintenance, and IT security for the business. Another option would be to hire a fractional CTO to analyze consumer segments, build business models, and act as a liaison between senior management and product developers. In this role, the CTO would prioritize corporate strategy. As you can see, the role of a fractional CTO spans departments, managerial levels, and business goals. We’ve found that, regardless of your company’s hiring objectives, the best fractional CTOs ultimately have a blended skill set that includes technical prowess, strong leadership, and a mastery of soft skills. Why Hire a Fractional CTO?: According to Tony Karrer, the fractional CTO for B2B media company Aggregage, “a fractional CTO works extremely well” in situations where a business doesn’t have a full-time CTO to handle strategy. Sometimes, Karrer notes, a fractional CTO will be added to a company’s upper management when the organization faces challenges with an existing development team. “Maybe they are missing deadlines or shipping product[s] with unacceptable levels of bugs. A fractional CTO can come in to help figure out what’s needed and how to adjust in order to turnaround troubled situations. ” Oftentimes, companies choose to work with fractional CTOs temporarily or on a contract basis. If you’re asking yourself why you should hire a fractional CTO, consider the following:  How familiar are your company’s executives with the technical aspects of your products, services, and technology? Did your organization’s CTO role recently become vacant? Do you have (or are you looking to build) an in-house or outsourced development team? Are your technological needs increasing in scope or complexity? Are you creating new products or applications? Is there a communication gap between your IT team and your executives? How much experience does your development team have making strategic business decisions?If you don’t have technology experts on your leadership team, a CTO is worth the investment. A fractional CTO is a great solution if you require a talented individual to fill the role, but either don’t have the resources to bring on a full-time hire or your business is still growing and doesn’t yet provide enough work for a full-time CTO. With a fractional CTO, you can address precisely the projects you’re prepared to tackle, and you’re getting a seasoned professional with diverse experience (and a fresh perspective!) at a fraction of the cost. Technology develops rapidly. To be successful in a competitive industry, it’s essential that your team has a highly skilled technology officer at the executive level who can evaluate and supervise suitable technology. You’ll do your business a disservice if you place a non-technical manager in charge of your technology projects. The benefits of having a fractional CTO are clear: They enable you to maximize internal resources. By outsourcing your CTO in a fractional capacity, you’re freeing up your internal resources. Your development team will operate at a higher level if they’re being supervised by a tech-savvy leader who possesses the right knowledge and expertise. Your team will have better guidance, clearer parameters, and a manager who can readily communicate with senior management. As a result, your products will be developed more quickly and with greater attention to marketable qualities. Additionally, by hiring a fractional CTO, you’ll relieve some of the responsibilities that other executives have added onto their roles. They save you money. Hiring a fractional CTO will save you not only time, but a considerable amount of money. Full-time, highly-talented CTOs can cost your organization hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. “Fractional CTOs deliver immediate value through experience at a lower cost,” argues Vaclav Vincalek, CEO of PCIS. “That doesn’t mean it comes cheaply – but you’re typically getting extraordinary value for what you’re paying with a part-time CTO. ” You’ll gain a new perspective. Adding a fractional CTO to your team will instantly widen your company’s perspective. Let’s face it – we all try to hire diverse teams with employees who can bring unique perspectives to our business strategy, but many companies experience a certain conformity when it comes to decision-making and strategizing. Ashutosh Mishra, a full stack developer, says that a fractional CTO can “provide an outside perspective to your current technological strategy [and] your team gets exposure and experience working with […] different professionals. ” You’re free to build your business. Working with a fractional CTO gives you much-needed guidance with product development, general IT issues, cybersecurity strategies, and business process optimizations. Having a dedicated resource in place enables your company to align technology, strategy, and business goals. Plus, since fractional CTOs typically operate on-demand, they’ll be up and running quickly to address your business priorities. How to Hire a Fractional CTO: Hiring a fractional CTO in 2022 comes with its own set of challenges. Had we written this in 2019, for example, we might suggest, among other tips, networking at in-person trade events and university campuses in search of promising talent. Given the ongoing pandemic and the explosion of remote work, however, we have a few suggestions on where to hire a fractional CTO and how best to do it. Leverage job aggregators…One of the simplest ways to find a fractional CTO is by posting your open position to job aggregator sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. Millions of job seekers use these platforms to find their next role, so you’re sure to encounter plenty of candidates. Keep in mind, however, that with these sites, you’ll receive a high number of applicants – and it’ll take up a considerable amount of internal resources to screen candidates. …Or work with a talent sourcing agencyIf you’re looking to hire a fractional CTO, you’re most likely seeking a hiring solution that provides immediate benefits at a fraction of the time and money it would cost to follow the more “traditional” route. Working with a recruiter or a talent sourcing agency will save you valuable resources and leave your team free to devote their time to revenue-generating tasks.

            "body": "2021/12/17 - Online coding challenges are incredibly popular – the top coding challenge platforms boast upwards of a million users – but what’s responsible for the high demand? Developers often credit these challenges as helping to improve their programming skills and confidence in their expertise. It’s simple: the more you participate in coding challenges, the more comfortable you’ll be in future job interviews and skill tests. If you’re looking to get started with online coding challenges, it’s really, really easy to do. There are so many resources out there for you to use – in large part because programming is an incredibly in-demand skill, but also because developers are generous with knowledge sharing and building community. That being said, there are two different routes you can take, many different resources you can choose from, and lots of opportunity for support and networking along the way. The Self-Guided Approach to Online Coding Challenges: Your first option is to take the self-guided route. If you choose this approach, you can use search engines and popular forums to find coding prompts that range from short-and-sweet, to open-ended, to highly-specific challenges. If, for example, you search for “PHP coding challenges,” you’ll find prompts like:  “Create a hello world page. For this challenge, create a PHP page with standard HTML, including head, title, and body tags. Since one feature of PHP is the ability to embed it in HTML, this will give you some practice doing that. Inside the body tag, create an H1 tag that contains a PHP section that prints out ‘Hello World. ’” “Using if, else, and elseif. Write a script that gets the current month and then prints out the season using if, else, and elseif. You don’t have to worry about the exact date of the season switch. Count June, July, and August as summer, and September, October, and November as fall. Count December, January, and February as winter, and March, April, and May as spring. ”(These were the first of many, many Google results – but we’re using these to give you an idea of what you can expect from a simple web search). Forums, like Reddit, are another goldmine. Here’s one subreddit to give you a starting point. This is a group of nearly ten thousand members who share detailed project ideas for beginners. Coding challenges on here range from beginner to advanced, but it’s easy enough to search until you come across an interesting prompt. To give an example of what you might expect, here are two popular challenges:  “Determine the least number of coins possible to make change. This is a somewhat simple one inspired by my working at a grocery store. Write a program capable of telling you the smallest number of coins you can make change with for a given amount. Examples, 25¢ should return 1, 35¢ should return 2, and 58¢ should return 6. I’m working off of American currency here but whatever you use should work just fine too as long as you adjust for it. ” The Reddit post provides “bonus features” for extra work.    “Build a reddit search system. Build a simpler version of reddit search system that will take a query as input and return the matching post results. Some instructions and examples are given below to get started (You can use any language you want. Instructions use javascript style just for representation)   // 1. Create some dummy data similar to reddit text posts   post1 = { title: ‘Build a reddit search system’, description: “Build a simpler version of reddit…. . ”, id: 1 }   // 2. Store all the data in one data structures e. g. array   postArray = [post1, post2, …. ]   // 3. Index postArray data for fast search (any changes you want to make for quick and better search. Google about “search indexing” or watch the video I shared.   function indexData(postArray){…}   // 4. Create search function that will print the returning posts   function search(query){…}   // 5. Bonus: highlight the matching lines  The Assisted Approach to Online Coding Challenges: If the thought of scouring the web for online coding challenges doesn’t appeal to you, or if you’re hoping for a more structured approach, there are some great resources you should check out. The major difference between a self-guided and an assisted coding challenge approach is the opportunity to receive feedback and accountability with the latter. While your own journey is unique, we typically recommend that developers just starting out with online coding challenges sign up for specific platforms. By joining a coding platform, you’ll get perks like automated grading, video solution walkthroughs, and the like. If you choose this route, there are (again) plenty of resources available to you. The most popular coding challenge platforms are TopCoder, Coderbyte, HackerRank, Codecademy, SPOJ, CodeWars, Project Euler, and Edabit. If you stumble across a different platform that works better for you, have at it – that list was by no means exhaustive. That’s what’s so nice about online coding challenges: there are infinite resources and plenty of top-notch options. However, plan to explore two or three different platforms before you commit. Coding challenge platforms allow you to filter by difficulty, programming language, and, depending upon the resource library, you can even select challenges used by specific companies (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon). Coderbyte, for example, has a massive library containing algorithm, front-end, back-end, and database challenges. Codecademy offers online coding challenges based on real-world technical interviews. If you get stuck, they have coding courses you can take to build out your skills. Edabit primarily shares bite-sized coding challenges (hence the name) and provides plenty of beginner tutorials. HackerRank holds coding contests, so if competition is a motivator for you, this platform would be an especially good fit. Next Step: Joining a Community of Developers: Once you’re comfortable with coding challenges and feel as if you’ve hit your stride with whichever programming language(s) you’ve chosen, challenge yourself further by joining a talent network. These are fantastic resources because they plug you directly into a community of developers and people all over the globe with similar skill sets/interests. Plus, top talent networks (especially ones that pre-screen applicants) grant you access to freelance-, part-time-, and full-time job opportunities. Whether you’re looking to network with peers, mentor beginner developers, or search for open roles, the Esteemed Colleagues Community is a fantastic resource. Regardless of the path you choose, let us be the first to wish you well on your search for programming knowledge! "

            "title": "How Do You Hire Programmers?",
            "thumbnail": "/uploads/thumbnail.jpg",
            "body": "2021/12/02 - If the thought of hiring programmers stresses you out, you’re not alone. The technical expertise needed to become a programmer doesn’t exactly overlap with other career choices. Programmers, known also as software developers or coders, are responsible for creating, testing, troubleshooting, and maintaining computer programs. If you’re looking to hire a programmer for your organization, you’ll want to find someone with sufficient proficiency with programming languages (C++, Java, Python, PHP, etc. ), math, algorithm coding, as well as data science and structure. A candidate’s soft skills like communication, problem-solving, patience, and accountability are more easy to assess. So, if you’re not a programmer yourself and are looking to hire one, what’s the best way to go about this? Luckily for you, it’s as easy as one, two, three:  Define your needs Cast your net (strategically) Screen your candidatesWhile hiring programmers can seem daunting at first, especially for people who are unfamiliar with niche technology and programming languages, there are so many apps and services on the market today to simplify the process for even the most technically-challenged among us. The challenge becomes, then, finding programmers with the skills and experience best suited to your needs. As you begin your search to hire programmers, keep the following in mind: Define Your Needs: There are plenty of programmers to choose from, but their expertise varies and you’ll find that most of the top tech talent is already spoken for, so to say. Keep your search manageable by defining your needs early on. Is your organization looking for a programmer to build out your site’s infrastructure? Do you need a cyber security specialist to consistently monitor your servers? A programmer could be anyone from a backend developer to a data scientist, mobile app specialist, full stack developer, UX designer, analyst, game developer, systems engineer, product engineer, and more. Simply put: if you aren’t specific with your needs, you’re going to be sifting through a lot of applications, many of which won’t apply to your open position. To further complicate things, depending upon your goals and projects, you may be looking for a freelance contractor or a full-time, on-site programmer. By taking the time to check with your stakeholders, decision-makers, and affected departments, you can get a clear idea of what skills your candidates will need to succeed in their position. This way, whether you need a programmer who can create and maintain front-end software, a detail-oriented professional to monitor your systems and protect your organization against cyber threats, or a developer with specialized expertise regarding specific programming languages, you can target the right person with your recruitment. Find Your Candidates: Depending upon your needs, you can join freelance networking sites like UpWork, Fiverr, Freelancer, or tech-specific talent networks like Esteemed or HackerEarth. If you’re looking to fill full-time positions, try sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Glassdoor. Many organizations turn to tech recruiters that pre-screen candidates, so if you’re pressed for time or want to focus one hundred percent of your team’s resources on business growth (as opposed to hiring tasks), this might be a great route to consider. A more hands-on approach to talent sourcing can also help you avoid bad hires. Sure, you’ll find talented programmers on LinkedIn and popular networking sites, but they’re also sitting behind your competitors desks, attending trade shows, and studying on college campuses. Sometimes the best candidates are the ones who aren’t actively trawling job boards. Screen. Screen. Screen. : Speaking of pre-screening, now’s the time when we hop onto our proverbial soapbox to say: whatever you do, however you go about amassing a list of applicants and potential hires, do not skip the screening step. Screen your programmer candidates before they reach the final stages of the hiring process. If you choose the wrong person for the job, you’ll lose time, resources, and a considerable amount of money. The U. S. Department of Labor has calculated that the average cost of a bad hire can exceed 30 percent of the employee’s first-year earnings. What’s more, the CEO for employer branding agency Link Humans argues that the average cost of recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and retaining a new employee is roughly $240,000. A Robert Half International study from several years ago surveyed CFOs, hiring managers, and HR professionals. They discovered that 39 percent of CFOs reported lost productivity as a result of bad hires, and managers have to spend almost 20 percent of their time supervising poorly performing employees. Think about that for a second: if you’re working a traditional 5-day work week, you’re wasting nearly a full day supervising a bad hire instead of completing your own tasks. Once you’ve posted a job opening for a programming position, expect to receive a very large volume of applicants. Whereas applications for other areas of your company can be filtered without the hiring team needing highly-specific knowledge, tech recruiting (especially when it comes to coding) requires technical expertise to screen candidates. If you’re unfamiliar with Drupal or JavaScript, how can you determine whether or not an applicant is proficient? Luckily, you won’t have to pull out a textbook for this. Once you have a list of potential candidates, you can screen them using skill tests and assessments — or by outsourcing to a screening-as-a-service company. (Here’s a great guide to screening tech candidates for anyone interested). By filtering out top talent from mediocre tech professionals, you’ll be much closer to finding the perfect fit for your programming position (and reduce the likelihood of employee attrition). Final Note: Hiring programmers can be stressful, especially if you don’t know much about coding. If you need to hire a talented developer and don’t have the time or resources to search for your own candidates, check out our network of pre-screened, highly-qualified, fully-vetted programmers and find a great fit in hours. Or, if you’ve already posted your job opportunity and have a thick stack of resumes waiting to be screened, try our screening service. Either way, you’ll drastically reduce your time-to-hire. Good luck! "

            "body": "2021/11/05 - Tech recruiting is challenging; there’s no way around it. The best talent is often gainfully employed, and even if you’re flipping through resumes of active job seekers, it’s difficult to find the right person for a tech role. If you’re reading this blog, you, like so many other recruiters, are hoping to simplify the hiring process by using technical recruiting tools. Sure, there’s an exhaustive list of technologies that can aid a recruiter: talent acquisition software, search tools, job aggregator sourcing platforms, calendar and email integrations, referral platforms, applicant tracking recruitment software, and a proper CRM solution, just to name a few. Unfortunately, you’ll find there are no “best” tools for technical recruiting. (We’re not alone in arguing this point: it’s a commonly held belief in the industry). It’s not the tool that makes the recruiter successful, but rather their traits and approach to finding top tech talent. That being said, let’s look at a few helpful tools, programs, platforms, and apps that are available to technical recruiters, before diving into the reasons behind our hesitation to overstate their utility. Useful Technical Recruiting Tools: Let’s break the technical recruitment process into four manageable parts: sourcing, tracking, screening, and onboarding. Each element of the hiring journey can benefit from various tools. Sourcing Tech Candidates: Job aggregators like LinkedIn, Monster. com, Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google Jobs are useful because they distribute your job posting to an infinitely larger audience than what your company website alone could attract. On LinkedIn, for example, 77 job applications are submitted each second. As for Indeed, their tool is responsible for 47 percent of all hires in the U. S. in 2020. These platforms are visited by active job seekers, so by utilizing these sources, you’re sure to get a large pool of applicants. However, while you’re sure to source more candidates, these tools will require you to perform more assessments and screening to find qualified applicants. Pro tip: One way in which to fast-track this part of the recruitment process is to find a tech-specific talent network from which to source candidates. IT talent networks provide recruiters and hiring teams with instant access to large communities of digital professionals, and, depending upon the network, access to pre-screened candidates who have already proven their skills. Tracking Applicants: Applicant tracking systems (ATS) like Breezy, Monday. com, Greenhouse, and Workable provide recruiters with tailored client and candidate experiences throughout the hiring process. With these tools, tech recruiters can track applicants and manage alerts and tasks. Automations such as email notifications, offer approvals, and stakeholder reporting save time and add considerable value. A Capterra study recently found that 75 percent of recruiters and hiring professionals use an ATS tool, but not without controversy. Many feel pressured to adopt new software tools to remain competitive, but the use of enterprise tracking systems in place of more traditional upkeep has led to pushback from job seekers. Capterra, the famous software vendor review marketplace, has coined the term “ATShole,” saying “[companies using ATS are] frustrating job applicants, scaring away new hires, and giving you a reputation as a company that doesn’t care about the candidate experience. ” This is a prime example of how a tool, even one as useful as a standalone applicant tracking system, can offer fantastic features and still fall short of actually improving the recruitment process. Screening Candidates: After sourcing candidates, all good technical recruiters will need to pare down the applicant pool. Candidate screening, especially evaluating technical skills, is a critical step in determining the best person for a job. There are several online skill tests and coding assessments, the recommendations for which are dependent upon the position for which you’re hiring. Regardless, there are plenty of options for assessing your applicants: HackerRank, Coderbyte, Hired Assessments, Devskiller, Qualified, etc. Many technical recruiters find this step in the hiring process to be particularly time- and resource-intensive, which explains the emergence of screening-as-a-service (more on that later). Onboarding New Hires: The best ATS solutions build onboarding into their system. Other options include Zenefits, TypeForm, Lessonly, and BambooHR. These tools help lessen the stress of paperwork, logins, and set-ups so new hires can focus on introductions to colleagues and projects, instead. Don’t underestimate the importance of this step. A Glassdoor study looking at the true cost of new employees found that “organizations with a strong onboarding process improve new hire retention by 82 percent and productivity by over 70 percent. ” Why Tools Aren’t Necessarily Your Best Option: Even if you have top-of-the-line recruitment tools, when it comes to hiring for technical roles, it comes down to the human element. This concept gets lost in our world of AI-driven candidate sourcing, screening, and assessment solutions. Even interviews, once the most humanizing part of the hiring process, have been digitized: just look at AI-powered video interviewing software. Don’t get us wrong — here at Esteemed, we love technology. We’re a community of developers, engineers, designers, coding enthusiasts, and self-described techies. We love the possibilities that we as humans can realize as a result of AI and machine learning. Our team prefers the type of recruiting that maintains a healthy balance of tech-driven screening and people-powered candidate assessments. Sometimes tech recruiting tools complicate things, even as they simplify others. We see it all the time: either recruitment tools don’t narrow down a recruiter’s applicant pool enough or they invariably weed out candidates who deserve a closer look. How Screening-as-a-Service Fills the Gap: For those of you who agree with this, we do have a pseudo-technical recruiting tool that you ought to consider. It’s actually more of a service than a tool: recruiters or hiring managers can either connect with a pre-screened tech talent network or submit their pool of applicants, and have their skills evaluated by a living, breathing technical lead. That way, whether a company has zero candidates or hundreds, they can find the best person for their tech role and not have talented candidates lost to algorithms or impersonal assessments. "

            "thumbnail": "/uploads/pexels-christina-morillo-1181676-3.jpg",
            "body": "2021/11/04 - If you’re wondering where to find top talent willing to work remotely, you’re not alone. In fact, many companies (startups and established enterprises alike) struggle with this. An Upwork report estimates that a staggering 1 in 4 Americans in the workforce will be working remotely through 2021, and that over 36 million Americans will work remotely by 2025. Additionally, according to Emsi data, the number of remote job opportunities has skyrocketed in 2021: from January through May of 2021, the U. S. had triple the number of remote job postings compared to the same time period in 2019. With these trending markers in mind, how do you find top talent that’s willing to work remotely, either in a part-time, contract-based, or full-time/traditional capacity? More people are willing to work as a remote employee these days (which is fantastic), but it hasn’t gotten any easier to separate the unqualified from the qualified, or the good from the great. Whether you’re looking to DIY your hiring or hoping to discover the “shortcut” that lets you spend your time working rather than recruiting, this blog is for you. If you’re looking to hire skilled professionals for a remote position at your startup, what’s the best way to go about doing it? 1. Start Within: Your startup has a hiring manager, right? Whoever’s in charge of finding remote talent needs to be properly trained and given the resources they need to get the job done right. Make sure your current team is prepared for giving remote interviews, understands the process, and is familiar with whichever tools will be used to attract and interview applicants. Your hiring manager(s) will be the face of your company and, consequently, responsible for a candidate’s first impression of the organization. If you want top talent, remember to put your best foot forward and demonstrate to those you’re interviewing that yes, it’s a great place to work and yes, the environment would be a great fit for highly skilled professionals. If they’re highly skilled, you won’t be the only organization vying for their attention, and one study by Glassdoor found that:  Fifty-six percent of workers ranked a strong workplace culture as more important than their salary, and Three out of every four workers admitted they consider a company’s culture before even submitting an application. Therefore, even if you find talented individuals, you simply can’t compete with other organizations until you look inward and establish your startup as a good place to work. 2. Tailor Your Search: Once you’ve prepared your hiring team and positioned your company as a great place to work, now’s the time to go out and find remote talent. If you post job opportunities on sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor, you can indicate that the position is a remote one, but bear in mind that your audience will be a mixture of traditional office types and remote workers. Posting on sites like FlexJobs, WeWorkRemotely, and other virtual-minded platforms will reach applicants who are specifically looking for remote positions and opportunities. Finally, you can take on a more active role by looking for candidates either on freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr (though this will require a lot of careful vetting and sourcing on your end) or by teaming up with a talent network of pre-screened professionals. 3. Don’t Be Afraid to Let Technology Take Over (a Little Bit): We’re preaching to the choir here (especially considering that you’re looking for remote employees) but we’ll say it anyway: technology is your friend. There’s quite literally an app for everything these days, so don’t be afraid to use tools to simplify your talent search and facilitate the hiring process. Even if you skip steps and don’t actively recruit your team (say, you simply wait for applications to pour in rather than seeking out potential talent by posting open positions on LinkedIn, Indeed, FlexJobs, etc. ) you’re going to get a lot of resumes. The issue then becomes sifting through the piles of CVs to separate talented candidates from the noise — and here’s where technology comes in. There are a variety of useful screening tools and platforms you can use to figure out which applicants have the skills and experience you’re looking for (particularly when it comes to assessing tech skills) that can be found with a quick Google search. Similarly, once you have a remote team, there are tools to ensure open communication and seamless collaboration (Zoom, Slack, Google Workspace, Trello, Asana, Monday, Wrike, Outlook…) but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. If you want to do the least amount of work and get the highest quality of talented remote applicants, use a talent network. These platforms are filled with people looking for virtual opportunities. Some talent networks are community-led, but others (like Esteemed) are run by an agency or provider to give the network greater structure, support, and accountability. What we love about these types of talent networks is that they’re so attuned to clients’ needs in finding the right person or people for a particular role. We have a talent network that numbers in the thousands for startups to choose from, and we also offer Screening as a Service for companies looking to fill remote tech positions without the added hassle of sourcing and vetting hundreds of potential candidates.

            "thumbnail": "/uploads/pexels-djordje-petrovic-2102415.jpg",
            "body": "2021/11/03 - The average base salary for a senior developer in the United States is $100,679, with additional compensation equalling about $5,000 per year. The average salary for a junior developer, in comparison, is $66,684, meaning that a senior developer typically makes about $40k more per year than their junior counterpart. If you’re wondering what exactly the difference between a senior developer and a junior developer is, we’re here to supply you with an answer. Oftentimes, we get this question when a company is building out their hiring requirements for a new IT role opening up within their organization. As they determine their candidate “must-haves” for a developer position, some recruiters have to ask: are they looking for a junior or senior developer, or does the distinction even play into their needs at all? Stereotypes, Soft Skills, and the Measure of Success: One Medium article explores the difference between junior developers and senior developers. Their input? “Like them or hate them, these labels are useful to help managers fill important roles and determine fair pay. ” To vastly simplify a very nuanced issue, junior developers are often viewed as avid learners with some knowledge of the language and technology stack with which they work. Senior developers are considered to have mastered their language and technology stack and be knowledgeable about security risks, standard application protocols, and the like. Some believe that a person can call themselves a senior developer not when they’ve reached X number of years in the field, but when they can self-manage their projects and handle the entire development life cycle — end-to-end — while either leading others or offering guidance to those around them. If a company wishes to place greater value on knowledge sharing and learning, there’s a stereotype that junior developers are more open to that than senior developers. Similarly, if an organization needs to find a developer to head a crucial business project, senior developers are seen as the “safer” option to choose. Be careful, though. On the one hand, a senior developer ought to have more extensive experience (and more time for their education and skill sets to have been tested) than a junior developer. On the other hand, an accumulation of hours doesn’t necessarily translate to a more talented developer. Generalizations, especially when it comes to the abilities of an individual, can only be so accurate. In a StackExchange forum, one developer wrote: “I’ve worked with companies, who defined a senior developer as someone with five years or more of experience. There is no mention to the quality of the experience, just that they sat in front of a computer for five years. In working with these folks, many of them had not yet grasp object oriented programming — yet they were considered senior developers. There must be a better more objective way to measure the skill set of a software engineer. ” To add to the debate, there has, in recent years, been a seismic shift in the way in which tech talent is assessed. A candidate’s soft skills hold a considerable amount of weight: if they’re communicative, collaborative, a team player, creative, optimistic, patient, flexible — these traits can boost a junior developer into a position that may otherwise have been earmarked for a more senior developer. Senior Developers vs. Junior Developers: Here at Esteemed, our team works primarily with developers. Different employers will come to us with different requirements. Progressive companies often weigh skill over experience, but many businesses still also look directly at how many years a developer has been working. Whether right or wrong, it’s still pretty prevalent, and everybody seems to have a bit of a different definition of what really constitutes “senior. ” The rule of thumb is that a junior developer usually has 1-2 years of experience, a mid-level developer has 2-5 years, and a senior developer has over 5 years of experience under their belt. This range varies from company to company, so, again, take that as a general guideline.  Junior Developer: 1-2 years of experience Mid-Level Developer: 2-5 years of experience Senior Developer: 5+ years of experienceWhen our team works with clients looking to hire either a junior or senior developer, we make the conscious decision to evaluate candidates based on both experience and skill. Unless a role specifically mentions “Senior Experience” as a non-negotiable requirement, we recommend candidates based on their skill level. This way, we’re able to place skilled candidates in roles that will give them more experience. (And, to be honest, we got tired of recommending senior developers, who certainly had the necessary amount of experience, just for them to get turned down for roles because their skills weren’t the right fit for the requirements). We see the most success this way. Just because our company’s screening policy allows us the freedom to emphasize skill level over years of experience for internal roles, doesn’t mean we automatically apply it to all of our clients. As we’ve mentioned, different employers will come to us with different requirements for open roles, and we don’t have much influence over what they say they’re looking for. That being said, if an employer finds a developer role difficult to fill, we’ll often advise them to tweak their requirements to open the doors for better-fitting candidates. Choosing the Right Developer For the Job: There are several best practices in the industry which can land tech recruiters the right developer for the job. Rather than limiting your applicant pool by requesting either a junior or a senior developer, it’s better to build a candidate persona, screen candidates for position-specific skills, and work specialized recruiting into one’s hiring strategy. By taking these calculated steps, as opposed to focusing on titles, companies can more closely match talent to opportunities. Looking to hire a developer? The Esteemed Colleagues Community and Esteemed Screening as a Service are two ways in which your organization can land top tech professionals (junior and senior, alike). "

            "thumbnail": "/uploads/pexels-magnetme-5839450.jpg",
            "body": "2021/10/25 - Let’s face it: the best tech talent is hard to find and even harder to recruit. Demand for quality IT pros far outpaces supply, which has resulted in a talent shortage and a competitive, high-paced environment. The current estimated unemployment rate for the tech sector is far below the national average at just 1. 5 percent — a mind-blowing statistic when you consider the market turmoil and global economic hardship brought about by the pandemic. This IT talent shortage is a tough problem for employers, but a welcome one for developers. Recruiters and employers have to compete for top tech applicants, whereas job seekers can “shop around” for the best position and the best incentives. Sure, poaching developers from other companies works, but it’s expensive, it’s time-consuming, and you have to be willing to offer more than the competition just to get an audience with a potential candidate. Referrals work, too, especially in the developer community, but the reach is still limited. The best bet, then, is to tap into a tech-focused talent pool, as these communities have already solved the biggest challenges that tech recruiters are facing, namely: 1. Tech recruiters are working with a serious talent shortage: Recruiters have a very hard time finding qualified candidates. A CompTIA trend analysis found that in the US alone, there were roughly 4 million employer job postings for tech-related positions in 2020 — while fewer than half the number of eligible candidates to fill them. By 2026 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics) the US will be short 1. 2 million engineers. If this skills gap doesn’t shrink, tech recruiters will struggle to find IT professionals with the experience and expertise these roles demand. The solution to this talent shortage? Either recruiters can reduce degree/professional requirements, and open their minds to non-traditionally educated applicants (like self-taught developers), or, if minimum years of experience and higher education requirements are non-negotiable, the other option is to work with a tech-specific talent network. By choosing this route, recruiters can connect with pre-screened, already-sourced IT candidates who have opted into a career-based platform. 2. Tech recruiters have a never-ending task: Once a recruiter finds (and signs) a qualified candidate, the work doesn’t end. Unfortunately, given the high demand/limited supply of developers and engineers, tech has the highest employee attrition rate of any business category (13. 2 percent). A programmer might commit to one company, but if a competitor comes along and offers a better salary/position/etc. , a high percentage of IT employees will jump to the next opportunity, and the recruiter will have to once again fill the position. It’s hard to find long-term tech talent, but it’s not impossible (and sometimes it’s not necessary). If the goal is to find a loyal candidate who will remain with the company for years, the best way to ensure this is to stand out and give them a reason to stay. To do this, the organization should invest in building a positive company culture, offer flexible work and good benefits, and (of course) offer more money than the competition. For businesses lacking the budget to attract top tech talent, the smartest thing to do is to plan for the inevitable: retain the people who are willing to remain and supplement any shortages by hiring contractors and freelance IT pros. Thanks to talent networks, recruiters can more easily find highly qualified candidates for short-term or open-ended contracts by posting new projects or positions to an established tech talent pool. 3. It’s a race against the clock: Recruiters know this all too well. Time isn’t on their side, as the best candidates are snatched up quickly. If a skilled developer is looking for a new job, they’ll typically go with one of the first offers as opposed to drawing the process out for weeks or months. To solve this challenge, the best thing a recruiter can do is screen their candidates so as not to waste valuable time and resources. It’s an added step in the hiring process, but it saves so much time, and time is critical here. It can be done manually, though now there’s the option to use a Screening-as-a-Service provider to save even more time. 4. Tech candidates, arguably, are hardest to screen: Candidate screening is such an important part of a recruiter’s job, but when hiring for a tech role, it can be tricky. Unless the recruiter is steeped in multiple programming languages, disciplines, dev environments, and popular tools, it’s difficult to properly assess an applicant’s skills. Sure, their resume says they’re qualified — but how can a recruiter be certain unless they themselves are an expert? Luckily, this challenge is one of the easiest to overcome. Technical screening can be outsourced. There are online coding assessments that candidates can be asked to take, and companies like ours offer augmented screening, technical interviews, and human-reviewed coding tests with detailed, actionable reports for recruiters. This way, even if a tech recruiter is unfamiliar with a certain skill set, they still have all the necessary insight into a candidate’s abilities and can therefore make the best hiring decisions. "

            "body": "2021/10/20 - Unless your organization has a hiring manager with extensive IT knowledge, you’ll find yourself asking this question when filling a tech position: what’s the best way in which to assess a candidate’s unique skills? How can you determine which applicant has the strongest technical expertise or which candidate has the right blend of experience and education? The simple answer is by performing a technical assessment. Depending on your situation and requirements, consider using a mixture of pre-screening, automated screening assessments, manual code reviews, and technical interviews. Keep in mind, however, that it’s most beneficial to your organization to use technical assessments after you’ve identified your specific needs. Let’s take a look at some of the things you should know before diving right into screening your candidates’ technical skills. Determine Your Project Scope and Duration: Before a technical assessment can take place, your team will need to identify the project’s scope and duration. Are you looking to hire one developer this year, or several developers this month? Does your organization seek candidates for permanent full-time roles, such as creating and maintaining critical technical infrastructure? Conversely, are you searching for temporary, part-time, or contract roles to add functionality (for example) to an existing web or mobile application? Your project may require hiring multiple developers in Front-end, Back-end, and DevOps roles. Define Your Project Domain: Your next step will be to identify likely technologies needed to implement the solution. For example, if your goal is to design, build, deploy and maintain a scalable and fault-tolerant cloud service, you may need an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. For Drupal applications hosted on Acquia, you’ll want a candidate with Acquia certification. Your project may require expertise with C++ or C#, JavaScript or Java, PHP or Python, Ruby, or Rust. Once you’ve outlined your project goals, scope, duration, and domain, it’s time to assemble your team. There are many methods for assessing a given candidate’s technical skills. We’ll explore one possible workflow below in order to give you a better idea of the process. 1. Pre-Screening Candidate with Technical AssessmentTo identify promising candidates, you’ll want to have them undergo a pre-screening test. Assessment tests may include open-ended or multiple choice questions related to the specific tech stack for which you’re screening. For instance, if you’re hiring back-end PHP developers using the Laravel framework, it’s unnecessary to quiz them on C# and . NET skills. Assessment tests may also include an algorithm challenge wherein candidates are asked to implement a solution — on the spot. This step is useful as a filtering mechanism to narrow the field from a large candidate pool to a manageable number of qualified applicants. 2. Manual Code ReviewOnce your candidates have passed pre-screening, the next step is to ask them for a code sample for review. However, depending on the particulars of the situation, this step could come before the automated assessment, or even replace it. In all cases, the candidate’s code sample should be reviewed by someone with enough expertise to identify whether it follows standards and best practices. More importantly, a good code sample should demonstrate the candidate’s ability to get the job done. If the project requires a Back-end engineer to implement a RESTful API, don’t accept code samples that demonstrate Front-end skills unless they also include an API integration. 3. Technical Interview with CandidateTo choose between candidates who pass the pre-screening and code review, face-to-face interviews (in person or remote) are necessary. Technical interviews provide the benefit of assessing a candidate’s soft skills. Some critical soft skills and traits to look for during the technical interview include:  Their communication skills Their collaboration skills Their ability to think strategically Whether the candidate portrays an optimistic, patient, flexible, and professional personalityEach organization has their own spectrum of requirements for soft skills, so it’s up to your company to decide whether your candidates satisfy the requirements. Final Thoughts: If these sound time-consuming to you, you’re right. A thorough technical assessment of your candidates can make or break your projects. Whether you’re just starting your screening process or looking to scale, you could benefit from Screening as a Service. By outsourcing your technical screening to the professionals, your company can be confident that it’s hiring the best talent for the job. "

            "body": "2021/08/24 - 2020 was a tumultuous year for all of us – job loss, unemployment, and a pervading sense of uncertainty clouded business and commerce. Thankfully, the workforce has been quick to adapt and overcome. Interestingly, the employment powerhouse Monster commissioned a special report to examine what lies ahead for the future of work, and, according to the study, “[the future of work] is surprisingly upbeat: 82 percent of the respondents plan to hire in the new year, and 93 percent feel confident they will find the right candidates. ” Recruiters’ concerns instead are trained on three all too familiar challenges:  Assessing candidates during the interview Identifying quality candidates quickly Effectively screening candidates (pre-interview)Let’s be honest. “All too familiar” is a welcome phrase in these uncharted times. It means we’re well acquainted, even comfortable, with the challenges we encounter. What’s more, in the world of recruitment and hiring there are well-established tools and techniques to address the above problems, so we’re not unprepared. So, when you’re faced with hiring for an open tech role, what do you do? How do you overcome these recruitment obstacles, sift through a growing pile of applications, and find the right fit for your team? You do it by screening and evaluating candidates the right way. When you post a tech employment opportunity, you’ll need help filtering through a large volume of applicants (this is normal with any open position). Unlike with other roles, tech-based positions come with an added recruitment difficulty – your own inexperience with highly-specialized, technical skill sets. Chances are you’re unfamiliar with programming languages and spotting brilliant lines of code. How, then, can you differentiate “good” from “great”? The solution is simple: by screening and evaluating candidates to find the right fit for your position. However, unless you’re an experienced developer or IT pro, you’re likely unfamiliar with the method by which you’ll go about filtering and assessing your potential hires. Read on to learn what your company needs to do in order to find the right fit for your open tech role. The Basics of Screening and Evaluating Candidates: What is candidate screening?: Candidate screening is the process by which your team reviews and assesses job applications. By this stage, you’re past the talent sourcing part of the hiring process. Your job is to figure out who has the skills, experience, and qualities necessary for the position, and who doesn’t. Candidate screening is time- and resource-intensive, but most importantly, it’s critical to keeping the best talent from slipping away. Why is candidate screening particularly important for tech positions?: By screening and evaluating candidates early on in the hiring process, you’re saving your team valuable time and money. This recruitment technique improves your efficiency and gives your company insight into your potential employees. For IT roles (including developers, architects, designers, project managers, and QA testers), there is a widening skills gap separating top talent from inexperienced individuals. Moreover, demand for tech talent far exceeds supply, so if you’re looking for a seasoned IT professional, you need to move fast. What are the most common methods of screening and evaluating tech candidates?: There are several ways in which you can successfully assess your tech candidates. To screen for the right fit, you can require applicants to take skill tests and job-specific assessments. Additionally, you can turn to résumé screening and cover letter evaluation, use an applicant tracking system, request phone and video pre-interviews, conduct background checks (including a review of a candidate’s online presence), and carry out reference checks. Some of these take time while others save time, but they all bring you one step closer to your goal of finding the best fit for your team. The Best Tools for Screening and Evaluating Candidates: Skill tests and assessments: Online skill tests and coding assessments are fantastic tools if you’re looking to hire a developer or IT pro. These tests allow your candidates to showcase their skills and personality, and more importantly, prove to you that they’re able to perform the tasks they’ll be expected to do. If you’re unfamiliar with Drupal but need to hire someone who’s highly skilled in the subject, you don’t need to crack open a Drupal for Dummies book – simply ask them to take a test. There are a variety of platforms that offer tests and assessments, but the best ones provide both pre-made tests, interactive coding challenges, and the option for custom assessments. Find a solution that balances automation and technical specification without compromising the human element. Take us, for example: Esteemed Screening engages over a thousand engineers and experienced technical leads who interpret each candidate’s test results and provide you with accurate feedback in easy-to-understand language. Applicant tracking systems: Applicant tracking systems (ATS) are software solutions that typically leverage AI to scan résumés and find the best candidate. They’re time savers: with ATS solutions, you can sort large volumes of résumés in a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually. The downside, however, is that by relying on automation, AI, and keyword-based filters, you can miss out on top talent. Plus, just because an ATS pings certain words doesn’t mean you learn anything about an applicant’s skills or experience. In our experience, this type of software can save you time, but often at a cost: you miss out on great candidates simply because you lose the human element of the hiring process. CRM: Candidate Relationship Management: CRM software isn’t only for your customers. Recruiters are increasingly turning to candidate-specific CRM solutions to help them build and maintain relationships with their applicants. For companies hiring developers and other IT pros where, as we’ve mentioned, demand exceeds supply. Because of this, CRM can attract and retain top talent. Show your candidates that they’re not getting lost in the talent pool – schedule emails to follow up with applicants every step of the screening process, take notes to remember important information, and personalize the hiring process for potential employees. Remember: you’re assessing them just as they’re assessing you! Screening-as-a-Service: With Screening-as-a-Service, you have the option to outsource your technical screening. If you’re short on time, low on expendable resources, or don’t have the technical expertise needed to thoroughly vet your candidates, you can find someone who can. Screening-as-a-Service provides you with a full screening and evaluating candidate experience. Simply submit your candidates and let a team of experts screen, assess, report, and offer thoughtful suggestions and insight. Next Steps: As you can see, there are many solutions to the challenges you face as you search for the right tech candidate. You can leverage the many available tools and platforms to screen and evaluate your candidates yourself, or you can turn to a Screening-as-a-Service provider. It all depends upon how much time and resources you can free up to devote to the screening process. If you choose to DIY, there are hundreds of articles which compare the various tools and services out there. If you choose to enlist the help of a Screening-as-a-Service company and team up to screen your tech candidates, we recommend Esteemed Screening. We use coding assessments, algorithm challenges, live technical interviews, and code reviews to find your perfect match.

            "body": "2021/08/19 - Not all business is created equal, and not all business challenges are universal. We may like to think we operate on a level playing field, but the obstacles that one organization must overcome are inherently different from the hurdles that another faces. An issue uniting all companies, however, involves the delicate art of finding and retaining top talent. For businesses in the tech industry, this challenge is compounded by the fact that supply can’t keep up with demand. Whether you’re a tech start-up, small business, or global enterprise, you’re searching for high-class developers and tech talent. The problem? Everyone else is, too. A global shortage of software engineers and skilled IT professionals means that those in search of new hires have a difficult task. For one, you’re competing against other organizations — and, thanks to an astronomical rise in remote work, you’re not only in competition with businesses in your area, but jockeying with companies in your industry around the country and across the globe. Additionally, for each open position that you advertise, you’ll receive hundreds (if not thousands) of applications, and it’s tedious to filter through these candidates to determine who’s qualified and who isn’t. The hiring process takes a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of risk. With so much at stake, it’s easy to see the value of screening candidates early on in the hiring process. How should you go about doing this? Two words: candidate assessments. What is a Candidate Assessment?: A candidate assessment is the process of determining whether a person is suitable for the role they’re seeking. It’s a catchall term, really, as the candidate assessment process may include:  Résumé review and verification of information Reference checks Background checks Behavioral assessments (to screen for cognitive abilities, risk aversion, etc. ) Skill assessments Social media profile reviews Pre-screening interviews Formal interviewsIn a nutshell, candidate assessments screen and evaluate applicants. For a new hire to succeed, it’s essential that they “fit” their role, the team, and the company. The best way to ascertain whether or not a prospective employee is the right fit before they join is by performing a candidate assessment. Why are Candidate Assessments Used?: Given their versatile nature, it’s no surprise that candidate assessments have multiple uses. Tech companies in particular use them to reduce risk. The turnover rate in the IT industry is the highest of any industry at over 13 percent. If you hire the wrong person for a position, expect to pay between 50–250 percent of the salary to find a suitable replacement. It’s crucial, therefore, to do your due diligence to ensure that you’ve found the best person for the job. In addition to being a risk management tool, candidate assessments are used by larger companies to streamline high volume recruiting efforts. No matter the size of a business, these assessments provide in-depth evaluations of potential hires so that a team can make an educated selection. Candidate assessments give employers insight. This is where their value lies. Companies gain a comprehensive understanding of a person’s professional background, skillset, abilities, and personality. This information allows employers to select new employees without taking a shot in the dark. Candidate assessments reduce employer risk, minimize the attrition rate, shorten time-to-hire, lower hiring costs, and improve the applicant’s overall experience. What Candidate Assessment Tools are Available?: Technological advances have revolutionized the hiring process. Social media provides us with an intimate look into the lives of others. Apps automate nearly every step of the screening process. Video conferencing allows us to have face-to-face conversations regardless of where we happen to be, and messaging platforms give us convenient access to one another. Employers can either tackle candidate assessments in-house or outsource them to experts. An entire industry has emerged to assist with the problem that all companies face: how to find the right talent in a cost-effective manner. Some things still require you to roll up your sleeves. Need to verify the information a candidate gives on their résumé? Someone has to make calls, hunt down addresses, and speak to references about prior work performance and education credentials. On the other hand, much of the candidate assessment process can be automated, and many steps even enlist the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, there are video platforms that use AI to “read” people during interviews and determine behavior traits and soft skills. It’s not just qualitative information, either. If you’re in the market for a developer, you can leverage coding challenges to assess a person’s tech skills. There are chatbots that pre-screen applicants, answer common questions, and unburden your team. For every part of the assessment process, you can find tools, platforms, and people to assist you. When used properly, they lessen hiring bias and elevate your diversity. You can even find platforms of sourced, pre-screened candidates if your team wishes to take on a more active role in the hiring and recruitment of new employees. Be selective, however, in choosing which tools, platforms, and services to use in evaluating your candidates. Machine learning is incredibly powerful and automations can significantly reduce your workload, but don’t lose sight of the fact that your candidates are real people, not data aggregates. Candidate Assessment Meets Screening-as-a-Service: Esteemed Screening was born to address the desire to pre-screen talent and the understanding that automated processes can unwittingly overlook top tech talent. Meet Screening-as-a-Service: we use coding assessments, algorithm challenges, live technical interviews, and code reviews to screen your candidates and determine how they fit into your organization. We know that no two candidates are the same, so we offer tailored screening. When you augment your candidate assessment process with Esteemed Screening, you’ll get a holistic picture of your potential hires.

            "body": "2021/03/16 - The modern job search is a challenging one. Demand for many open positions outpaces supply, and for those seeking employment, job fulfillment is a critical piece to factor in. Whether you seek a pay increase, career advancement, or a fresh start, your job search requires patience. While online applications have made the job search easier, the number of applicants has skyrocketed, and data shows that only 2 percent of applicants actually get interviews. You simply cannot expect recruiters and hiring managers to respond to every inquiry. What makes a candidate successful? It comes down to mindset. While some people dread the job search experience, others embrace the challenge. We all experience anxiety and frustration when the stakes are high and the uncertainty is higher. Simply knowing that you are not alone — that this is a normal response to an important life change — might allow you to adjust your mindset and normalize the fear. In the 1970s, psychologist and author Suzanne Kobasa researched what she called “stress hardiness. ” She studied executives at Bell Labs to better understand what made some people more resistant to stress than others. Those executives didn’t eschew stress; they befriended their stress by responding in a more positive manner to stressful events. Kobasa discovered three attitudes about stress and resilience (the Three Cs), and her findings can be applied to modern job searches. By employing a proper mindset and embracing pressure, you’re well on your way to landing a more fulfilling job. The Three Cs: Challenge: Challenge is the first step to changing from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Rather than viewing challenges as threats to the status quo, stress hardy individuals see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. This strategy opens your mind to creative thought and boosts your motivation. Begin your search by engaging in a period of self-discovery to appreciate who you are and what you are grateful for in your life. Look deeply at your professional and personal successes to build confidence and trust in what you know about yourself. You may want to journal about the types of positions that interest you, and why you are qualified for those positions. You can revisit your writings when you have a bout of imposter syndrome. Use your insights to update your resume so that it better reflects your achievements and growth. “Your resume is ultimately your unique story of professional experience,” argues Arnie Fertig, founder of a career coaching organization. “[A proper resume includes] challenges, what you did and what you attained. It tells the story of a discrete set of work activities, the skills you’ve attained and the education and credentials that enable you to perform as a valued employee. ” When you change the lens through which you see your situation, you may find more positive and motivating ways to manage your job search. Embracing a growth mindset adjusts your perspective on failure by seeing challenges as opportunities to learn. Commitment: Commitment is feeling connected to your sense of purpose, and is closely aligned with values. Examining your values will help you to find fulfillment in your new position. If this is difficult for you, start by listing three to five people you admire. Then write down the traits of those people that resonate with you. You will begin to notice patterns that will reveal your values. By keeping your values at top of mind, you can be more intentional about the positions you apply for, ensuring that your next opportunity will align with your needs. If a job description triggers an emotion, take a moment to notice how you feel. Are you triggered because you don’t feel smart enough, or are you empowered because the position might lead to a new growth opportunity? Find meaning in your job search by taking an active approach. Take the time to find a job that aligns with your goals and values. This will keep you focused and engaged, even if faced with temporary setbacks. Control: Whether you view life as something to control or something that controls you, either way the outcome is added stress. Accepting what you cannot control and taking action on what you can keeps you from dwelling on the “should haves” and the “what ifs. ” The “should haves” are those regrets that arise from a past event. For example, if you aren’t offered the job, you might assume that you “should have” answered an interview question differently. But that might not have been the reason you weren’t hired. Rather than beating yourself up over your hindsight, recognize that there may be other explanations out of your control. Then you can begin to learn from the experience and accept the situation. The “what ifs” are the narratives in your head about the future. “What if” I don’t get the job? “What if” they don’t like me? Catastrophizing the possibilities is exhausting. When we agonize over the uncertainty of the future, we become anxious and demoralized. Recognize which aspects of the job search you have control over, and seek balance in how you control your situation. Plan, practice, reflect, ask for referrals, and be patient. Accepting that you are in an uncertain situation gives you space to befriend yourself with kindness. Final Thoughts: When you see resiliency as your ability to cultivate a more productive attitude towards stress, you are less likely to be driven by emotional reactivity. Here are some final tips for applying the Three Cs to your self-aware job search.  Adjust your expectations. Recruiters and hiring managers are busy. They may not get to your application. It isn’t necessarily about you.  Be prepared. When you come into an interview prepared to tell your story, you will be perceived as authentic. Practice your pitch and responses to questions. Begin a meditation, breathing, or movement practice to calm your nervous system.  Be on time. Rushing keeps us from experiencing that moment of present connection. Whether interviewing online or in-person, arrive early, feel your feet on the floor, and take a few deep breaths for grounding in the present moment.  Engage in listening. During the interview, focus on the questions and not your response. Active listening keeps you in the present moment so that your mind doesn’t wander off. Managers are trying to assess your problem-solving skills; not make you feel incompetent. Rather than allowing feelings of self-judgment to arise if you don’t know the answer to a question, be honest when you reach the end of your knowledge.  Cultivate kindness. Always extend a thank-you message after the interview, connect on LinkedIn, and follow up on next steps. Build a relationship by engaging. If you want others to value your worth, return them the same courtesy.  Rejection hurts. If you don’t do well during the interview or if you fail to get the job, recognize that you don’t know with whom you competed and what value they brought to the table. Your self-worth is not tied to getting the job. Review your resume and interview, noticing whether there are things you could do better next time, and accept the outcome. A job search deeply tests our ability to be resilient. Practicing self-awareness — authenticity, non-judgment, acceptance, self-compassion — puts you in a position to reframe your job search as a learning opportunity. If you still find yourself highly stressed, recognize when you need outside support. Stay healthy by connecting with friends and getting enough sleep, good nutrition, and exercise. While not everyone may see your value, you can be confident in your own self-worth. Your next opportunity is right around the corner. "

            "body": "2021/02/16 - In 2022 the tech industry continues to respond to the adjustments required to manage, support, and maintain a productive, hybrid workforce. Several software development trends from 2021 are advancing and continue to expand rapidly, causing tech tools to evolve and change how people work. If you’re looking to make some changes in your organization or planning for changes in the future, keep an eye on these ongoing software development trends for 2022. Low-Code/No-Code Persists As the ongoing tech talent shortage occurs, low-code/no-code (LC/NC) applications continue to drive growth. “No-code is the future of software,” according to Katherine Kostereva, a Forbes Council member and CEO of, Creatio, a global vendor of one platform to automate industry workflows and CRM with no-code. It’s no wonder Kostereva is optimistic with Gartner’s full-scale projection of $5. 8 billion for the low-code application platform market. The low-code application platform market expects to grow by more than $73 million by 2027, according to a recent comprehensive report by Market Research Future (MRFR). Many IT organizations and business leaders are turning an eye toward providing their staff with the ability to become “citizen developers” with LC/NC applications, thus giving their teams the power to create problem-solving applications for the company’s greater good. In a nutshell, LC/NC applications allow non-technical staff to customize or create the tools they need with little or no coding. Think “WordPress” and content management systems (CMS) as earlier LC/NC application forms. Some of the primary benefits of LC/NC include the ability for organizations to own their automation tools and customize them for quickly changing business needs. Embracing LC/NC allows companies to leverage hyper-automation for progress and free up A-list developers to focus on increasing speed to market for their proprietary business initiatives. LC/NC applications have created another option for companies that streamline traditional process management tools, such as software administration, workflow, or case management systems. Other application uses include virtual assistants, chatbots, and function-specific tools for marketers. However, LC/NC does have its drawbacks. Security concerns around LC/NC applications will require companies to ensure their workforce is up to speed on cybersecurity best practices for LC/NC development. Also, organizations will need to create frameworks for their “citizen developers” to ensure knowledge around the use of LC/NC tools becomes prolific and align with IT objectives. AI and Machine Learning Keeps Expanding: Rapid growth continues to accelerate changes in AI even though some still consider it in the stage of infancy. By 2024 the global artificial intelligence (AI) market is expected to reach $500 billion, according to predictions from IDC. Currently, most AI smart algorithms can focus on single performance tasks such as recognition systems or personalized recommendations. We’re moving toward the second stage of growth, where the intelligence of machines can equal humans. Google and Microsoft lead the way in offering AutoML and no-code AI software solutions, creating a machine learning pipeline that is more transparent and simple. No-code AI software development platforms automatically create ML, and AI models apply them to real-world issues. They have a user-friendly interface, drag-and-drop features, and no need to code. Google’s TensorFlow framework is considered an excellent tool for deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Recently Google garnered attention for its perceived human-like chatbot when a Google engineer believed the chatbot had become an eight-year-old child. Still, experts waved away the leap in advancement and said it’s not sentient. Regardless of the sci-fi excitement, the role of AI and ML software solutions is growing as they improve processes, reduce manual work and help achieve better business results. Manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and logistics use AI and ML solutions. Cybersecurity and Data Loss Prevention Remain a Top Need: The modernization of applications and services and the continuing workforce shift to hybrid and work from anywhere keep cybersecurity top of mind for most IT and software developer professionals. For many enterprises to remain competitive, retain customers, and avoid incompatibilities with the latest technological advances, they need to migrate their data and processes to new platforms. For example, without the upgrade, some organizations will not be in a position to harness security trends such as DevSecOps (development, security, and operations), which embeds security throughout every stage of the DevOps process, versus at the end, where organizations could be vulnerable to cutting edge threats. Cybersecurity technologists are particularly in demand from state, city and county governments. CIOs and CTOs working for government organizations anticipate budget increases in the coming years to increase protection from outside threats, transfer big data into the cloud, and update legacy systems. The need to address outdated systems is the primary reason for the surprising but necessary surge in high-paying requests for developers with knowledgeable language skills in Clojure, Erlang, F#, and COBOL. These programming languages are well suited for processing large amounts of data, supporting AI, and solving complex problems across platforms to update legacy systems that will no longer operate efficiently with the latest technological advances. For example, Clojure is well suited for processing large amounts of data related to data mining/commercial AI and large-scale predictions where parallel processing is needed. Erlang has built-in runtime support systems for distribution, concurrency, and fault tolerance required in procedures necessary for high availability and massive scalability in real-time such as instant messaging, telecom, banking, and e-commerce. F# is an open-source, cross-platform, and interoperable universal language known for its ability to write succinct code giving developers relief from debugging and focusing on a problem domain rather than the details of programming. Cloud Reliance on Hybrid Architectures Continues with Edge Edge computing is evolving to save bandwidth and improve response times, safety, and customer experiences for organizations leveraging cloud services. In 2022 the IoT, AI, and machine learning are continuing to spur the growth of edge computing, enabling new applications and data models. By the end of 2022, edge computing is expected to reach $176 billion and sustain growth through 2025 to reach $274 billion, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Edge Spending Guide. For those new to the concept, edge computing is an architecture with a topology location-sensitive form of distributed computing that brings computation and data storage closer to the data sources. Current uses cases of edge computing cloud services include:  Adjusting the timing of traffic signals to manage traffic Collecting patient data from monitors and sensors to provide patient insights Routing sensor data to wind substations through cell towersAnother growing trend for companies’ projects requiring scalability, security, and 24/7 availability is Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes is a good tool for managing containers, building a micro-services architecture, and automating the software deployment process. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, Oracle, VMware, SUS, and Platform9 all offer Kubernetes-based platforms or infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Another option exists to utilize the latest cloud technologies, serverless computing. Serverless architecture can offer more flexibility, quicker time to release, and greater scalability at a reduced cost. Developers do not need to worry about purchasing, provisioning, and managing backend servers with serverless architectures. If you’re still wondering how the various hybrid architectures options work together, here is a valuable guide: Edge Computing the Hybrid Cloud: 3 Approaches from David Linthicum, the Chief Cloud Strategy Officer at Deloitte Consulting.

            "body": "2021/02/08 - Sourcing talent and hiring new employees are some of the most challenging — and important — tasks that managers face. We all know the feeling of being overwhelmed by the process, despite our best laid plans and intentions. How often do we hire the candidate who looks to be the right person, only to find ourselves recruiting for the same position just a few short months later when the new hire doesn’t work out? The truth is that we aren’t always good at hiring. We might talk ourselves into thinking we’ve found the right person simply to end a process that has taken up more time and resources than we’re willing to spare. We may, conversely, drag out the hiring process indefinitely in the search for the “perfect” person. We might have two great candidates and no way to decide between them. And, frankly, we may find the process a distraction if we have pressing work or family obligations. Our issues with hiring are rarely a result of not having good candidates from which to choose. More often than not, our challenges are the result of our own lack of self-awareness. In decision-making, we often fall back on impulses and miss out on a great candidate because we don’t realize we can make better choices. Finding ways to be open and objective can be elusive, especially if we feel pressured to get the hiring done. Rather than relying on our intuition, we can turn towards mindfulness to aid us in the hiring process. Jon Kabat-Zinn, the father of secular mindfulness, defines mindfulness as paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and without judgment. Mindfulness is a way of being, often practiced through meditation, that teaches us to focus and concentrate, to be aware of our emotions and thoughts, and to cultivate acceptance. Let’s examine how mindfulness can help us make better hiring decisions. Active Listening: There can be no communication without listening, and while it’s safe to say that most of us have never taken a class in listening, it is the cornerstone of all our relationships and one of the greatest skills we can cultivate. When we fail to listen deeply, we risk misinterpreting the conversation. We may, for example, find ourselves only half listening to what is being said. Even worse, we might focus too much of our attention on how we are going to respond, and completely miss both the words and the underlying subtleties being expressed. Mindful listening is about setting an intention to listen. According to Mindful magazine, we can follow the HEAR process:  Halt – give your full attention to the speaker Enjoy – take a breath to absorb what is being said, whether positive or negative Ask – conduct self-inquiry; do you really understand, or are you making assumptions? Reflect – repeat (in your own words) what you heard to validate your understandingMute your phone, pause notifications, and give your undivided attention on your candidate. Consider asking a predefined set of open-ended questions that you can use consistently with each candidate so that you can evaluate their soft skills. For example, ask questions such as, “Tell me about a time you were on a project that failed. What would you have done differently?”. This type of question allows you to move your focus from the candidate’s personality to their capability. You’ll get greater insight into how a candidate sees themselves in times of both triumph and adversity, too. Try to understand the other person’s perspective, even if you don’t embrace it as your own. By becoming better listeners, we open the door to being intentionally present during the interview process, without being clouded by judgment or emotion. Overcoming Bias: It is human nature for us to want to socialize with people with whom we identify. After the 2004 presidential election, a poll found that 57 percent of undecided voters would rather drink a beer with Bush than with Kerry. We’ve been using that question, “Who would you rather drink a beer with?” ever since. Implicit bias is an automatic process that influences our hiring decisions. It’s our gut feeling. We may not realize that there exists a bias within ourselves in the areas of race, ethnicity, age, gender, socio-economic status, school attended, and even how a person looks, sounds, or dresses. But within 90 seconds of meeting a candidate, an opinion is formed. Although our decisions might seem genuinely objective, we often don’t recognize that the best person for the job was eliminated solely on the grounds of our own implicit bias. Studies show that mindfulness can reduce our tendency towards implicit bias. It is only when we become more conscious of our own bias that we can begin to make decisions from a place of greater objectivity. We say that mindfulness has two wings: wisdom and compassion. Tapping into these qualities makes deep change possible. Wisdom: Mindfulness requires that we pause our response in order to access higher brain function and make more intentional choices. Self-awareness is at the heart of mindfulness practice. Take the time to sit with your thoughts, emotions, and body sensations for a few minutes each day. Notice your patterns without engaging with the narrative. With time, you will find that you will be able to respond more intentionally, rather than reacting in the moment. Bring that self-awareness into the hiring process, and you can begin to access your propensity for bias. Compassion: Have you ever realized your tendency to beat yourself up over a mistake you’ve made, whereas if it’s your best friend who’s made the error, you’re much more accepting? As we begin to notice our own bias, we may find that our values aren’t as aligned with our actions as we thought. This can lead us to feel uncomfortable and to criticize or blame ourselves for not being “better. ” Self-compassion training, particularly loving-kindness meditation, allows us to see that deep down, we are all part of a greater humanity and deserve respect and kindness. The beautiful thing is that once we find self-compassion, we show more compassion to those around us — especially to those who are different from us. Mindfulness teaches us to turn inwards and constantly question our motives and actions. We then can begin to notice our bias triggers and replace them with more objective evaluation metrics. By lessening our cognitive bias, we improve decision making and the bottom line. Leading with Intention: We lead with intention when we focus on guiding and engaging employees to meet their full potential. This includes sharing a vision of where the company wants to move and how to make it properly positioned for the future. When we infuse the hiring process with intention, we are creating a culture of acceptance in which we honor what each employee brings to the table.  It’s time to leave behind the concept of “cultural fit” and replace it with “cultural contribution. ” We can foster team building not by hiring people who are exactly like those currently on the team, but by bringing together people with valuable unique contributions. This drives innovation, creativity, and diversity, thereby allowing our organization to grow and adapt to its environment, new trends, and the needs of our audience. To get out of your autopilot hiring mode, practice mindfulness. Everyone has their own unique ways in which they’ll contribute to your company culture. Mindfulness will help you cultivate the deep self-inquiry necessary for building an intentional team that embraces those differences. In doing so, you’ll not only set your employees up for true success, but lower the risk that they won’t work out in the role for which you hired them. Mindfulness enhances clarity and focus. It allows us to recognize the value of multiple perspectives and backgrounds, and it builds compassion for ourselves and those around us. When we question our beliefs, sit with the uncomfortable, and cultivate acceptance, we take a step towards creating a workplace that attracts dedicated employees who are eager to take on our vision.

            "body": "2021/01/26 - It’s a huge understatement to say that 2020 made an impact on economies around the world, let alone workplaces and hiring practices. As the concentric circles of crises converged, our personal, local, and global outlooks shifted like never before. As we all settle in to the “new normal,” the challenge of landing talented tech pros remains high. Our need to adopt future proof talent sourcing, hiring, and retention is greater than ever. Streamlining the process is still top-of-mind for most CTOs, especially during this perilous time in history. One-size-fits-all recruitment, generic job listings, and backward-looking retention strategies are a thing of the past. With the harnessing of big data, the cloud, and the surge in video conferencing — yes Zoom, Slack, and Meet are officially verbs — we’ve all entered the #futureofwork. Let’s take a spin through eight important developments in this updated world of work and talent acquisition. The arrival of a global talent pool: At the height of the pandemic 50-70% of the US workforce was working remotely. Two-thirds or more say they want to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. Agile, distributed teams have been a necessary sea change for many big tech companies like Google, Twitter, Microsoft, and Facebook. And their employees say that without a remote option in the future, they’ll be unlikely to stay.  “Remote work tantalizes with its promises of diverse talent pools, increased productivity and retention, and savings on salaries and facilities, not to mention smaller carbon footprint. ” — State of Remote Work 2020 Work From Anywhere is now a benefit to both candidates and employers. And in our hyper-connected world, we have access to a global talent pool of top tech candidates.  In 2020, the use of company video meetings grew 50% more than pre-pandemic 77% of employees agree that post-pandemic, a work from home (WFH) option would make them happier 75% have been the same or more productive during COVID-19 while WFHExploding the traditional Talent Acquisition model: Contactless recruitment and virtual hiring are booming. High tech HR and hybrid workforces have become commonplace for businesses and brands to ensure safety and efficiency. But companies are also thinking about more than streamlining time-to-hire, they’re thinking about nurturing long-term relationships and building diverse, global, A-list teams. The employee value proposition (EVP) has become top-of-mind for many recruiters as a holistic approach to building innovative teams. This process starts long before the job listing for most. By building a culture that resonates with prospective employees you can boost talent sourcing and retention. And it’s one of the top reasons talent will choose to work with you. 93% of employees mention the importance of company culture in their online job reviews. They want to not only feel like your brand is worthy to put on a resume, but also that your mission and values align with their own. Artificial intelligence vs hiring for soft skills: HR automation tools and the desire to up your business’ digital IQ are trending. But as we’ve discussed the perils of the hiring industrial complex, most of the solutions you’re being sold don’t have results to back them up. A focus on soft skills and retention is the new, main focus for many businesses thinking beyond simple hiring algorithms. Looking beyond the resume is a tactic smart businesses are employing worldwide. “… Around 66% of all new jobs will mainly rely on soft skills. Some of such top soft skills are collaboration, problem-solving, and communication. ” — 10 Recruitment Trends for 2020/2021 Top 10 Soft Skills in the Future of Work:  Sense-making Novel and Adaptive Thinking Social Intelligence Trans-disciplinarity New Media Literacy Computational Thinking Cognitive Load Management Design Mindset Cross-Cultural Competency Virtual CollaborationSource: Institute for the Future &amp; Univ. of Phoenix Research Institute Fast-forward to upskilling/reskilling current employees: Cross-functional has taken on a whole new meaning in 2021. As many companies seek to do more with less, they’re looking to internally upskill or reskill their current employees.  “Reskilling is defined as training for employees who have shown they have the aptitude for learning a completely new occupation…. Upskilling focuses on providing training for employees who need to learn new skills to improve their current performance without changing their position or career path. ” — U. S. Office of Personnel Management With internal mobility on the rise, look for a recommitment to investing in the most talented team members. Verified and transferable skill sets, adaptability, and resilience are in high demand. Flexibility and efficiency at the forefront: Without a daily commute, the definitions of a workday and work-life balance have shifted dramatically. But that doesn’t mean we’re getting less done; quite the opposite.  “On average, remote employees worked an extra 26 hours each month during COVID (nearly an extra day every week). ” — State of Remote Work 2020 With the latest data about the counterintuitive output of diverse, globally distributed teams, the 9-to-5 model is getting tossed in the trash. Innovation starts with processes that embrace the flexible schedules and multiple timezones of top talent. And success stories are legion when these models are employed by future-thinking HR teams. Empathy, diversity, and equity: Actions will speak louder than words in the coming years. With social justice, the pandemic, climate change, and so much uncertainty around the world, your brand is more vulnerable than ever. Transparency and equity have become tantamount to success. Showing that you understand the day-to-day struggles of your team members — and their communities — will help win the hearts and minds of future candidates.  “Diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace will become a real driver of employment decisions. Increasingly, the best talent will look for visible evidence of a company’s commitment to diversity within the interview process, within the hiring team, and within the executive leadership of the company. ” — Carin Van Vuuren, CMO at Greenhouse Software Skills, not country of origin or cultural orientation, define the talent of the future. By broadcasting inclusion and accountability, businesses can embrace and incorporate the next generation of stars. Mental health awareness and acknowledgment:  “It goes without saying that this pandemic coupled with the social and political unrest of this year has exacerbated the stress, anxiety, depression, and mental health issues of workers. ” — 5 Ways 2020 Has Impacted Workplaces And How It Will Change In 2021 Mimicking in-office culture in the Matrix of Zoom meetings has become exhausting. As we try to maintain some touchstone of normality, burnout has crept in with the overuse of technology. “No meeting days” are trending for overall sanity and output. 80% of employees now believe that there should be one day a week with no meetings. Meditation, yoga, and therapy are being encouraged by C-level executives as a replacement. Flexibility is taking on a whole new meaning in the boardroom and beyond.

            "body": "2021/01/14 - We know the unique challenge today’s businesses face hiring top tech talent. There’s never been more demand or fewer qualified IT pros actively searching for positions. And most agencies and brands plan to up their digital IQs in the coming wave of Industry 4. 0. That’s why landing the best developers for your ongoing project needs is still the #1 concern in the executive suite. “PwC’s 2017 CEO survey reports that chief executives view the unavailability of talent and skills as the biggest threat to their business. ” — Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong, HBR That hasn’t changed, in fact it’s only gotten more dire. And it’s no secret that the hiring industrial complex has become a drain on resources with little proven benefit. Why the #FutureofWork is about more than just filling your funnel with warm bodies: 40% of US companies now outsource their hiring process. These recruitment outsourcers then use subcontractors to scour LinkedIn and social media sites for passive candidates. It’s why currently employed IT pros report being contacted multiple times a day about their interest to change jobs. Keeping your top tech employees has become a war of the “highest bidder. ” But it doesn’t have to be a game killer. We’ve talked about how smaller businesses can compete to stand out in the minds of prospects. And making your weaknesses your strengths is not about going toe-to-toe on salary, compensation, or benefits packages. It’s about sourcing talent with an eye to the future. Is your hiring approach backward-looking or future proof?: Making the best possible choice on who to hire for your team has become increasingly difficult. But the hardest part isn’t necessarily which overseas vendor or software to outsource it to. With over a decade of expertise helping brands and agencies source respected developers, we see this mistake a lot. It’s a lack of foresight toward sourcing for culture and retention. The toughest part about building an A-class team is still how to architect success. And how to do it in the most efficient and complementary way for your business. Having access to a deep pool of proven, respected, and vetted talent has become a huge commodity. And we know this from experience. Big data and hiring algorithms won’t save your business: In the long run, those passive IT hot shots aren’t necessarily worth the investment, sadly. And companies already throw $20 billion a year at human resource vendors when they don’t have to. Outsourced candidates don’t always contribute right away, and this can be disruptive to current employees. There’s also no evidence that passive hires are of a higher quality, and they often take longer to onboard to potential. This unsustainable model of outsourcing, filling the funnel, and hiring unknown commodities can actually drain resources over time. And no one can afford that right now. Outsourcing your hiring to recruitment farms won’t solve your two bigger problems: Time-to-hire and quality-of-hire. And more algorithms fail to factor in vectors specific to your exact business. Is your applicant-tracking software worth the headache?: That applicant-tracking software you think will save you money, may actually cost you in company culture. It might seem nifty out of the box, but are their proven benefits to measuring body language? Algorithms and so-called efficiency bots lack the context of what’s needed most in the sourcing through retention processes. The human touch, and the structure and proven vetting that actually get results. Unfortunately, analytics are often flawed and backward-looking. We’ve never experienced such an important and innovative time in our culture than right now. With the rise of cutting-edge tech — and the necessary players to implement it —there’s no question that your hiring process needs to be seamless. “Artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality, 3D printing, and combinations of these, are viewed as cost-cutting and revenue-generating opportunities. ” — PwC’s 2020 CEO Survey Don’t go pound-for-pound with hiring gorillas without help: When it comes to auditing your hiring and acquisition strategies we know there are always questions on how to save time and money. But there’s no obvious shortcut to success. Why not trust a talent sourcing network with a proven track record?

In Part One you established your minimum viable business (MVB), or product (MVP) to move ahead with a modest investment of time and resources. The leaner the better at the outset, so take the Occam’s Razor business approach. The simplest answer is often the correct one, for now. For developers planning to sell their IT expertise as a service, you’ll still need to network with like-minded peers. Contribute regularly to community networks and stay involved in coding events and camps. Remember, “Know, like, and trust” is how you establish your reputation as an authority in your niche. This makes it far easier to leverage your relationships into a viable service or product people need. As a freelancer, you’ve already …  Determined your rate range, low to high; Defined the type of work you like most and are best at; Committed to seeking out contracts based on timing; And planned to layer at least two contracts concurrently for “insurance” purposes. ‘Rise and Grind’ is a harmful myth: We mentioned that burnout is a real thing in our industry, and your mental health is a precious commodity, so pace yourself.

Now that you’ve established yourself as the go-to authority in your niche you’re ready to make good on your promise. Whether your business plan entails SaaS, coaching, consulting, courses, or straight-ahead freelancing you’ll need the business basics kit: 1. Create a unique LLC for your brand  Your Secretary of State LegalZoom2. Get accounting software to invoice clients and keep track of time and expenses  Freshbooks Quickbooks3. Find business insurance to protect yourself from liabilities  Hiscox Local Agent Note: If you’re working on a SaaS product, there will be far more legalese and IP rigamarole. You’ll also need to plan on a longer timeline/runway to launch. (Disclosure: We’re not lawyers) 4. And create a marketing plan that includes Owned, Earned, and Paid media channels  Website and email list Github or community contributions and involvement Google Adwords, Facebook ads, sponsored updates on Twitter, or InstagramABCs of how to keep work coming in: We hear this question all the time, “Sure I want to freelance, but how do I keep the work coming?” Here are a few solutions for establishing a foundation for the long haul:  Your LinkedIn profile: Your personal web page connected to a search engine specifically for your skills and experience. Don’t make the mistake of wasting it.  Job boards: As a tight-knit community, we can keep an eye on just a few places to capture new opportunities.  Client career pages: Your best clients are your existing clients. Keep an eye on past client career pages. As needs arise, reach out and offer your assistance. Important factors to keep in mind doing client work:  80% of your volume is going to come from 20% of your clients, focus on expanding those relationships; Communication is the key to building and maintaining relationships; Your best clients are often your existing ones; Define your criteria for a “good client”; Quickly dispense with those that don’t to save time and money. No one needs a drill bit, they need a hole in the wall: “Benefits not features” is a great marketing slogan you can adopt. No one needs more software, what they need is the timeliest solution to their problem. When devising your business plan be sure to develop an ongoing client or buyer persona. This will help you to stay in tune with their “hopes, fears, and dreams. ” Your niche audience or market will change over the years, just like all markets. And remember that markets are conversations. Be sure to speak to your clients in their language to establish effective communications throughout your relationship. Staying relevant (and in-demand) means adjusting your product-market fit iteratively. We like to lean on the Japanese concept of “Kaizen” which refers to taking small steps each day to reach your goal.  Master one to three specific tasks, especially ones you’re good at; Niche skills are great, but complementary niche skills are better; Focus on improving in areas you are weaker; Obtain certifications in niche disciplines and languages; Obtain endorsements on LinkedIn; Take code screenings on LinkedIn and CoderByte (used by Esteemed).

There are multiple opportunities for establishing monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for yourself including:  Monthly maintenance - use or lose hour blocks, be competitive, make some offshore friends to support; Audits - monthly security, SEO, or ongoing strategy audits can add to MRR options; Content strategy and production - if you are a developer, hire someone to do the work, add a margin on top; Retainers - ongoing consulting and feature enhancements. By continuing to keep up with industry trends and network with your peers you’ll not only improve your entrepreneurial skills but also your standing in the community.

You’ll need to dig deep into the specifics of why exactly your service or solution is something people will pay for.

Learn how to sell yourself: Some of the best advice we can give freelancers is learning how to market yourself. You’ll need to learn a few basics to get your services in front of clients.  Outbound activity on LinkedIn, phone calls to those that might consume your services Define deeper niches (non-profits, agencies, government) Target your most excited, qualified, profitable leads and customersUnderstanding the Pareto Principle – that 80% of your revenue will come from 20% of your customers – is a natural law and a proven business tactic.

            "body": "2020/12/07 - When it comes to auditing your talent sourcing and acquisition strategies we know there are always questions on how to save time and money. But there’s no obvious shortcut to success. If you’re lucky enough to have an in-house HR team you know how much each member juggles on a monthly basis. But if you’re a small startup or agency it might just come down to who wears the “hiring hat” that week. When you’re looking for support who can you turn to? Many recruiting firms claim to have access to deep pools of specialized talent. The reality is they’re looking at the same generic pool of candidates you are. And when it comes to landing top IT pros, the pickings are slim. Specialized vs. general recruitment: We see the growing shortage of talented tech hires every day. It’s no mirage, and there are predicted to be an additional 5 million IT jobs added to that growing sea by 2027. You wouldn’t go to a general practitioner to treat a highly specialized problem, would you? You would go to a specialist with expertise in that issue. So by tapping into specialized recruiting to help you fill highly-technical roles you’re relying on specialists referring specialists. And this can give you a huge advantage. The global talent shortage is real: You’re not alone. 72% of employers report having a hard time finding skilled candidates, especially for hard-to-fill positions. It’s also a growing epidemic that can impact your bottom line. By enlisting the expertise of a niche specialist for your recruiting needs you can save invaluable resources. You’ll not only tap into a deeper pool of talent, but you can also boost time-to-hire and quality of hire. Specialized recruiters become a natural extension of your HR team. Trusted envoys who can help broadcast your company culture and mission. Time-to-hire power up: Boosting time-to-hire not only saves you money, in the long run, it also boosts innovation. By taking the pressure off your recruiting team you’re freeing up time and brainpower. Having someone vet your candidates for you takes the guesswork out of having to do multiple assessments and behavioral interviews yourself. This lets you focus on what really matters. Soft skills are often overlooked by general recruiting firms because they’re more interested in warm bodies. Generalized recruiters don’t typically look beyond the resume. But recruiters who can talk specifically to your most valued acquisitions’ needs do. And getting talented new hires in the door faster lets your team focus on their core competencies. Culture-building and quality of hire: A recent study by legacy employment site CareerBuilder found that 66% of US employers reported having been affected by a bad hire, with 27% saying a single bad hire cost them more than $50,000. With a specialized recruiter, you’ll be building a team of contributing superstars right out of the gate. And specialists who speak the exact language of your business needs can help support your core values and diversity. Lean on the tried-and-true experience of a specialty firm that talks the talk. Don’t play Russian roulette with your most trusted asset, your people. Onboarding and the race for talent: We understand the pressure businesses face competing for top talent. Don’t try to go “pound-for-pound” with the big guys when you don’t have to. Remember that recruitment and retention actually start by sourcing talent smarter. Not by trying to compete on salary, compensation, or benefits packages. Save yourself the headache and enlist help from the start. The key to the next digital revolution will be access to deeper networks of talented and diverse voices. We talk to developers every day who can speak to your needs. We are specialized colleagues recommending the best of the best. We’d love to chat about all of your hiring needs! Drop us a line anytime. "

            "body": "2020/11/02 - How can your small business compete for top talent? Maybe you’re a lean startup operating on a shoestring. That doesn’t mean you can’t attract impactful players to your team. If the fight for talent was a boxing match, smaller businesses and larger companies aren’t in the same weight class. There’s no competition. So getting innovative about how you stand out in the minds of prospects is the key. As the digital frontier becomes more competitive by the minute, any advantage helps. Smaller teams are scrappier: Your weaknesses as a small business owner don’t have to be a disadvantage. The future of your business depends on attracting the best candidates. But recruitment and retention actually start by sourcing talent differently. Not by going toe-to-toe on salary, compensation, or benefits packages. Career fairs can give an unfair advantage to the big guys. You’ll need to go where talent is having conversations with each other, not where big brands are sucking the air from the room. 70% of the global workforce is passive talent: Top talent is passively job-hunting all over the world and web. Though not actively looking for a gig, they’re always keeping an eye out for better things. Speaking to them is not hard, and listening to their hopes and fears is even easier. They’re hanging out in online groups, chats, forums, and Slack channels sharing their frustrations and tips on how to get ahead. Not only that but they’re having conversations in your community on channels you use every day. And both passive and active job hunters share a common trait. They have FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to their peers and the competition. If their friends work for an inspiring startup that shares an incredible culture … they’re bound to want in. Create a culture of inclusion and innovation: You can start a conversation with prospective talent by simply reaching out to see what they’re up to and nurturing a relationship. No strings attached means you can easily gather intel. You’ll win friends and influence people by going off-script and avoiding buzzwords and bullet-points. Eventually sharing why your business culture and mission stand out is how so many startups succeed early on. Setting out to build a culture that resonates with prospective employees should be a rung in your talent acquisition strategy. And it’s one of the most important reasons top talent will choose to work with you. 93% of employees mention company culture in their online job reviews: But how do you sell culture the old fashioned way? By establishing substance over style. By differentiating your small business or agency from the soul-crushing ethos of big corporations. Only then can you can appeal to the hearts and minds of your new hires. And by creating a unique culture, brand, and mission that feels like a “velvet rope” experience, you’ll have them lining up to get on the list. The power of social media, the human touch, and referrals: In this era of digital disruption, reputation management is critical. Branding your small business to emphasize culture on all channels boosts your time-to-hire and quality-of-hire. And emphasizing the unique human touch of a small business to prospects is important. By showing that working for you will be a rewarding experience for growth and opportunity that isn’t mired in bureaucracy. Setting up a referral program can give your hiring a shot in the arm too. Referrals most often come from your current employees. Colleagues recommending colleagues. We’re big believers in the power of community and building teams based on word-of-mouth talent networks. You can attract some incredible people that way, we see it every day. Non-traditional compensation packages are the new normal: The future of work is flexible. By selling your culture, and needed job flexibility, small businesses can win top talent. As your business grows you can incentivize the experience by rewarding employees for referrals that make it past the critical six-month rubicon. And by offering new hires equity, a chance to be a part of a unique brand, and more growth opportunities, you can stand out from the big guys. Every job opening is an opportunity – Feedback FTW: With every job opening comes great responsibility. Even with the standout job applicants, you don’t hire, you can nurture long-term relationships that can lead to future hires. “Talents are 4x more likely to consider a company for a future opportunity when a company offers feedback. ” — SHRM Customized Benchmarking Report By nurturing future talent at every juncture you’re giving your small business or agency a great shot at delivering that one-of-a-kind work/life experience. We love helping to empower small businesses with the talent sourcing to staff smarter. We’ve been sourcing a talent network of over 13,000 top tech professionals for over a decade. There’s nothing more rewarding than helping inspiring brands build incredible teams. The future depends on it. If you’re looking for help with your talent sourcing strategy drop us a line!

            "body": "2020/10/21 - Whether you work with in-house, remote contractors, or fully-distributed teams, the way you onboard new employees is crucial to your long-term success. By creating a repeatable process for sourcing, orienting, and assimilating new employees you’re giving your business the best chance for retention. And it starts well before the day they begin their new gig. The onboarding process can start as soon as the ink dries on any agreement — and before — for your best outcome. Many successful companies have begun to onboard potential employees before they even fill out an application. They reserve a portion of their website for orienting potential hires and to broadcast company culture.  “Companies that excel at onboarding and employee retention experienced 2. 5 times the revenue growth and 1. 9 times the profit margin of companies who struggle with these two critical skills. ” How to build retention from the inside-out: We know the pain points so many businesses face engaging and retaining top IT talent. And for many tech pros, starting a new job has never been more stressful. So we’ve put together a helpful list of some onboarding basics to help you get new hires where they need to be. And it’s built by setting them up for success in their first year. The first six months are a proving ground for any employee. 30% of new hires will quit within six months of starting, and 16-17% within the first three (BambooHR). Why do so many new employees leave so soon after starting? It’s not rocket science, in fact, they’re more likely to tell you in online reviews than ever:  23% will leave due to unclear guidelines around their new job 21% because they feel they’ve received ineffective training 17% due to a feeling of isolation or lack of social bonding 12% because they feel their work goes unrecognized And 9% will leave because of a lack of feedback from superiors and co-workersThe difference between “quick” vs. long-term onboarding: Building an effective and creative team of problem-solvers is expensive. So ensuring that your employees make it to that critical one year mark should be imperative. Onboarding process planning questions all companies can start with:  When will your onboarding begin for new employees? How long will it extend? What is the overall goal for new employees at the conclusion of the: First day … First week … First month … First three months … First six months … By the end of their first year? What will new employees need to know about your company culture, mission, and office set up – or remote processes – prior to starting? How does your HR team assist in the onboarding process? Managers? Co-workers? Will your organization create a dedicated onboarding team? Can you create social media content that promotes company culture? What about producing a video orienting new hires to the company culture showcasing success stories and more? Will you create an onboarding collaboration system — or kanban board — for tracking where employees are in the process? What milestones and long-term goals will need to be set for new hires? And how will you and your team measure the success of your onboarding KPIs moving ahead?Pre-onboarding for the win: One survey by Aberdeen Group showed that 83% of the most successful organizations begin onboarding before a new hire’s first day. As soon as your new team member has accepted an offer the onboarding process can begin. Even before that critical first day — always a slog — you can get them into your funnel and on the path to a long career. Pre-onboarding suggestions to smoothly transition new hires:  Create a dedicated area on your website or Slack to welcome new employees and begin the process.  Automate some of the tedious processes for new hires to help them speed up their assimilation and measure their progress.  Have new employees e-sign docs gradually instead of having them piled on all at once.  A friendly note and welcome kit from a new manager or the CEO can go a long way to acquainting them.  New hire announcements and welcomes from co-workers also establish the kind of social onboarding that new employees need to feel invested.  Ask them to interact with company social media accounts to promote connection.  FAQs about the first day and a glossary of company terminology helps otherwise competent pros feel confident going into meetings full of unfamiliar internal jargon.  An electronic handbook outlining a summary of job expectations and any boundaries around their new position can set them up for success right away.  Point to suggested reading and success resources for additional fulfillment.  Make sure they have all the tools they’ll need for a smooth and successful first day including: Having their new office or tech equipment — or remote setup — ready to roll, including software and operating systems.  Passwords, logins, and any security access required to do all the things needed to interact with the team.  A real or virtual coffee hour to get to know the team prior to diving into the nitty-gritty of the first day.  Be sure to refer back to interviews to learn more about your new employee’s soft skills, whether they are introverted or extroverted, and how to best incorporate those talents. Expectations at the outset build engagement: Accountability and small wins breed success. And giving your new team members all of the tools they need is a key to retention and attaining objectives. First-day checklist ideas:  Get team members set up with their new office or tech equipment.  Establish emails, aliases, and access to online platforms needed to communicate effectively.  Be sure to reiterate roles and responsibilities for not only new hires but the whole team.  A company directory, map, and org. chart can acquaint them faster.  Have them start the onboarding roadmap prepared for their first-week that outlines the goals and knowledge they’ll need to acquire.  Invite employees to join the onboarding collaboration system — or kanban board — to see where they are in the process.  Establish a training timeline and details they’ll need for any training sessions.  Set expectations for what knowledge or testing to expect after training is completed.  Set them up with a mentor or two who can help them along the onboarding journey.  The importance of social onboarding and maintaining an ongoing relationship goes a long way to retention. Seeing a smile on a friendly face is always a bonus.  Invite them to get to know their co-workers by asking them personal questions about their interests and pursuits outside of work.  Plan a social interaction like a team lunch — or virtual meet up — for new hires on their first day to get to know them better.  Have them get started on their initial assignments right away.  Set them up for some early wins in the first few weeks so they feel confident in the first month.  Promote inclusivity to help all newer employees feel socially connected to staff both old and new.  Check-in with them to be sure they’re feeling confident and have all the tools required to do their job.  Encourage over-communication and not to be shy about asking questions. Confidence builds long-term loyalty: Companies most successful at onboarding saw 62% of their new hires meet their first performance milestone, and 91% were still part of the team after their first year. First-week onboarding ideas:  Be sure to re-emphasize new team member’s responsibilities and accountability for tasks in the weeks ahead.  Clear goals + realistic expectations = Short term wins.  Arrange daily one-on-one check-ins with either mentors or managers to establish consistent support.  Get feedback — anonymously when possible — as to what they feel is or isn’t working in their first week.  Continue to include new hires in company events, social gatherings, and ways to promote your business culture and diversity.  Establish ongoing training updates, cross-training timelines, and details for any upcoming sessions.  Set expectations for what knowledge or testing to expect after additional training is completed.  Give ongoing reviews and establish high-level goals and deliverables for 3-6-9 month intervals. Wash, rinse, repeat. Inclusion, empowerment, and social acceptance: Success is built iteratively and each new team member will have their own concerns, feedback, needs, and hopes for their future with your organization. Taking the time to onboard over the first year will save you money in the long run. First-month onboarding ideas:  Establish a one-month check-in and informal review to ensure team members are finding the resources they need to succeed and hit benchmarks.  Get more feedback — anonymously when possible — as to what they feel is or isn’t working.  Check-in with their mentors to establish the effectiveness of training and guidance.  Continue to encourage engagement in company events, social gatherings, and promotion of your business culture and diversity.

Give ongoing reviews and establish high-level goals and deliverables for 3-6-9 month intervals. Build culture, community, and ongoing communication: After the first three months, your new team members should be well familiarized and entrenched in both your company culture and their new responsibilities. Three-month onboarding ideas:  Establish a three-month check-in and informal review to ensure team members are finding the resources they need to succeed and hitting benchmarks.  Get more feedback — anonymously when possible — as to what they feel is or isn’t working.  Check-in with their mentors to establish the effectiveness of guidance and finalize training.  Continue to encourage engagement in company events, social gatherings, and promotion of your business culture and diversity.  Give ongoing reviews and establish high-level goals and deliverables for 6-9 month intervals. Six-month onboarding ideas:  Establish a six-month check-in and performance review.  Get more feedback — anonymously when possible — as to what they feel is or isn’t working.  Check-in with their mentors to establish the effectiveness of guidance and set goals for the next two quarters.  Confirm that employee has received all required training.  Continue to encourage engagement in company events, social gatherings, and promotion of your business culture and diversity.  Establish high-level goals and deliverables for the first year. First-year review:  Perform a yearly performance review with your star employee.  Be sure to broadcast their first successful year at the company.  Discuss the hopes for the upcoming year’s projects, milestones, and KPIs.  Address any feedback, questions, and needs your employees may have for the future.  Review compensation and raise policies.

            "body": "2020/10/06 - When it comes to trusting your software projects to outside developers, is it best to look for onshore or offshore contractors? Every business or brand will have vastly different needs when it comes to their software. Smaller startups have begun to use more offshore developers to stay competitive, while larger companies still rely on in-house or onshore teams. The differences can make a big impact on your bottom line, so which one is better? Your mileage may vary, but it doesn’t have to with the right resources. Support local vs. foreign vendors?: The growth of high-quality offshore developers in regions of the world like Europe, Asia, and South America means top global talent at your fingertips. And companies around the world are taking notice. Using in-house or onshore IT experts is like supporting local businesses. They incorporate and do their business in the same country of origin as you. But the rise of better online collaboration tools and cloud computing means managing distributed teams is easier than ever. And there’s no longer an ethical stigma for working with globally outsourced companies. Business data leader, Statista, reported the global offshoring and outsourcing market in 2017 was ~$90 billion. Offshore companies can now compete for the same jobs with incredible success from all over the globe. The “new normal” is our interconnected web of IT pros working seamlessly, regardless of language or timezone. Access is everything: Any business in need of those competitive digital niches can now access a diversity of quality problem-solvers. Using onshore developers can reduce the anxiety that comes with working with a distributed offshore team. But remember, “96% of software and IT companies allow remote work in some capacity. ” Backdoor offshoring by local development teams in not uncommon. And advancements in global internet security make offshoring far more appealing than it once was. Just be sure to research and define your software development needs thoroughly before choosing a path forward. Some things to consider about each before evaluating your best option: Onshore development:  Cost - Average higher cost, smaller more competitive talent pools.  Communication - Often in the same time zone can mean quick, same-day comms with little delay. Face-to-face meetings are easier to schedule.  Collaboration - With recent advancements and tools like Slack, Trello, JIRA, and Yammer, this is a coin toss between onshore vs. offshore.  Quality - Often a higher quality of both talent and code. Fewer discrepancies in iterations to successful product launch.  Security - Onshore companies will be governed by your country’s regulations making copyright or IP laws transparent from the start. Offshore development:  Cost - Lower cost, greater access to multiple disciplines, but can often come with its own price, including greater oversight required (i. e. higher project management costs).  Communication - Slower communications, language barriers can mean some unavoidable delays. Face-to-face meetings can be difficult to schedule.  Collaboration - Again, a coin toss between onshore vs. offshore.  Quality - There is a potential for drift if teams aren’t properly overseen by a Project Manager. Talent can be equal to onshore but vetting can be unpredictable to non-existent.  Security - Though IT security solutions are evolving daily there is still some risk involved. Offshore companies may not abide by your country’s copyright or IP laws. You could also consider a hybrid approach. Project management has become a high priority for distributed teams. Consider the best use case for each. Onshore is often best for larger, labor-intensive development projects that require multiple disciplines and/or custom software design. Offshore can be utilized for maintenance of ongoing projects, simpler one-off jobs, or upgrades to well-established infrastructure. Many businesses aren’t hesitating to utilize offshore developers in expanding fields like AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Talent and technology are exploding around the world. There is no wrong answer: Remember that no matter which path you choose the two options can be equally valuable. With the right mix of transparency, collaboration, and consistent processes, you can boost quality and speed to market. Take it from us! There is still objective quality when it comes to your software project, and we value only the highest quality talent at Esteemed. We know that finding top talent in those highly technical disciplines can be a drag. Employers are already spending way more time than ever courting, recruiting, and simply keeping their best. Work with the best of the best!: We’ve touched on some of the challenges employers face when sourcing top tech candidates. And with the shortage of top-tier IT candidates, it makes sense to turn to staffing made simple. We’ve employed both great Eastern European developers as well as US and Canadian IT experts. A hybrid methodology works, it just depends on which key elements you need in your business plan, and how well vetted they are. With over a decade of experience, we love helping businesses save time and money so they can focus on their core competencies. Drop us a line anytime and we’ll be happy to help you find the best team for your business! "

            "body": "2020/09/30 - You’re probably facing the same challenge as so many other businesses right now. As you try to predict the “new next,” and watch the explosion of Industry 4. 0, how can you stay ahead of a curve that steepens daily? We’ve all been forced to adapt to an unfamiliar digital landscape at the drop of a hat. And technology has grown all-consuming across the business world. Brands are racing to keep up with consumers and many are facing the hard truth about finding top tech talent. There’s a shortage of experts, and getting them to the table is harder than ever. The challenges of sourcing skilled tech talent: Finding top talent in hard-to-staff and highly technical disciplines has become a marathon. Employers are spending more time than ever courting, recruiting, and trying to keep the best of the best. It’s not your imagination. Demand for developers has skyrocketed in top tech fields like AI, cloud computing, and blockchain. But the tried-and-true job markets like mobile app development and cybersecurity haven’t cooled off.  In an annual CIO Survey by KPMG, over 3,000 tech leaders shared their frustration and “an astonishing 65% said that hiring challenges are hurting the industry. ” You are not alone: We’ve touched on some of the challenges employers face when sourcing top tech candidates. The time commitment alone can be a huge drain (twice as long on average for tech niches). But the shortage of top-tier IT candidates is no laughing matter. Many engineers report being solicited on LinkedIn an average of 30 times a day — even while currently employed! Demand has never been greater in emerging fields like AI and machine learning. For instance, machine learning engineer job openings increased by 344% from 2015 to 2018. The popularity of cloud computing for startups and the incorporation of AR/VR by big companies are also soaring. The numbers are staggering: demand for an AR/VR engineering role grew 1,400% in 2019. Generic job postings don’t work anymore: How can your business leverage access to top talent without losing time, money, and your sanity? Your generic job posting on Indeed or LinkedIn might get applicants, but you can’t guarantee that you’ll find applicants with the amount of experience you’re hoping for. As the future of work now seamlessly blends our digital and physical worlds, there’s no time to waste. Staying competitive means finding access to talent pools. Modern tech startups are leveraging cloud-based platforms and apps to provide cutting edge digital experiences to customers. And they’re doing it faster and cheaper than ever before. “Every company is a technology company”: Without the right talent for the job, implementation becomes impossible. No matter how great your idea is, you need the right team of proven problem-solvers. Employees and customers expect your tech to keep up with their lives. They require a digital experience that is both seamless and inspiring. This new labor market demands innovative solutions to bygone problems. So why not take some of the guesswork out of one of your most important acquisitions … your tech talent. Speak the language of your candidates: IT professionals take pride in their credentials and abilities, and they also value their peer reviews. Soft skills also play a larger role in the power of building effective distributed teams. Speaking to those highly skilled tech candidates, however, requires knowledge of the demands of the job. And often those job descriptions are poorly interpreted by recruiters with little tech know-how. HR executives and corporate recruiters can be caught flat-footed trying to filter the average candidates from the great ones. It’s more important than ever to know who you’re gunning for. IT experts are now more willing than ever to evolve with the new digital frontier. They keep up with the latest advancements and coding languages to future-proof their careers. They want you to speak their language — and speak to their employment needs, too. Better talent = better solutions: By tapping into a deep reservoir of vetted, experienced talent, you’re giving yourself some breathing room. The world of tech is changing so fast. Don’t let recruiting and vetting weigh you down anymore.  “[Eighty-three] percent of executives say that talent acquisition is important or very important. Concerns about talent — especially top technology talent — have led many organizations to invest in […] building deeper talent pools. ” Take it from us, we’ve spent over a decade networking and speaking with over 13,000 digital professionals. Our Esteemed Talent community is built on trust — we are top tech talent recommending colleagues. We’ve taken the guesswork out of staffing those positions for you. All in one easy-to-use channel. Let us do the recruiting, sourcing, and assessments. Every veteran team lead at Esteemed screens our deep talent pool with rigorous code reviews and personality exams. But we’re more than just a job board for nerds. We’re a community of experts recommending experts. To learn more about how we can help you, just drop us a line. We’d love to chat! "

            "body": "2020/09/21 - Finding the best candidate for your business or brand has become increasingly challenging for HR and recruiting teams. And Quality of Hire is more critical to the success of your business — and your bottom-line — than ever. But with the shortage of IT pros with experience and a passion for your project, the time to hire has ballooned astronomically. The industry-wide average is now a stunning 42 days, and even longer for hard to staff niches. That’s almost a month and a half of your time and energy! There are proven methods to help you zero-in on the best talent out there, but the digital landscape has fractured the ways candidates look for work. Some are actively looking on platforms you might not know even exist, while many are passively awaiting a job change. And the way candidates think and talk about your brand and hiring process has shifted with the times too. Top talent can be picky, deservedly, and they know exactly what they’re looking for. They also read the reviews of your business and hiring processes on job boards.  “Employers also spend an enormous amount on hiring — an average of $4,129 per job in the United States, according to Society for Human Resource Management estimates…” — Harvard Business Review Between cost, and finding a culture fit that will equal retention, a lot of companies just aren’t able to fill positions. How to streamline your talent sourcing: So what are some ways you can streamline your talent sourcing? One simple solution is by creating a “candidate persona” to help you target the ideal professional for your job. As we’ve discussed, there are formulas for filling the unique needs of your organization. Growing a network of talent that is agile, diverse, and shares your companies values is a great start. Making sure that your organization is clear about its needs and the most efficient ways to fill them is key. But unfortunately, AI algorithms can’t always read beyond the resume. We’ve talked about using a data-driven approach to homing in on talent and using more passive methods of relationship building. Community-building and long-term nurturing have grown popular among savvy tech companies. When it’s time to drill down and get serious about who the best fit might be, you’ll want to do some boots-on-the-ground research. Not only about who’s applying to your current roles, but how your organization envisions filling future ones. Go beyond the resume to zero-in on future talent: Creating a candidate persona will help you zoom in on your ideal candidate before you need them. And those highly sought after digital professionals need to know exactly why they’re a perfect fit for you. Collecting data from your own team is a perfect way to analyze exactly who that may be. By getting into the head of a semi-fictional version of your ideal candidate, you can streamline the process. Not only can this crystalize your job descriptions it can set a course for the future of your recruitment strategies. Remember “75% of long-term job success depends on people skills, while only 25% on technical knowledge. ” Micro- vs. macro-targeting: To start, you can survey current employees and stakeholders about what makes your organization a great culture fit for them. Look further than their job titles or accolades and dig into their interests, motivations, and inspirations. What are their goals for the future and why are they a great fit? Where do they spend time hanging out online and who do they follow? Ask them about their fears and hopes. Then translate that into company-wide trends that can help you understand what exactly you’re looking for in your next hire. You’ll need to decide how wide or narrow to focus the lens on who you’re looking for. For this, you can simply add or subtract the number of questions you ask your team. Then translate those into the criteria you use to create your candidate personas. How great companies iterate the hiring process: Create a working model of what a great fit for your company looks like and then iterate from there. You’ll obviously need a different persona for each future position, and you can be as general or specific as needed depending on the role or category. Start with the basics:  Professional background Experience and qualifications Skills Interests Career goals Online hangouts and influencersThen give your semi-fictional applicant a name and a heartbeat with some company-specific spice. Dig into some of the desired soft skills that make current employees of your organization desirable. Choose from whatever pops out:  Quirks that make them a good fit Communication and collaboration style or preference Creative muses Flexibility and demeanor when things go wrong Potential objections to working for youBy creating a composite sketch of your ideal candidate you’ll be on the road to getting to know your (future) talent better. And by using a flexible template you can help your recruiting team understand your needs and streamline your hiring process. Benefits of creating a candidate persona: Once you’ve got your candidate personas you can use them to not only clarify your job descriptions but to sharpen your company messaging as well. The benefits to your recruitment strategy are trickle-down. By attracting the right people you’ll boost retention, reduce the cost to hire and improve company culture and diversity. And during these times when technology seems to be all-pervasive, this can only help to humanize your business or brand. Pre-qualifying candidates saves you time and money: Esteemed has been in the game long enough to know. With over ten years of experience, we understand the importance of finding only the best candidates for agencies and clients. That’s why we use a multi-dimensional approach to vetting and qualifying every member of our Colleagues Community. Our team-leads use both skills assessments and advanced personality tests to help remove steps in the hiring process. By reducing the time to hire for our clients and our providers/candidates, we’re saving everyone a little sanity. And who couldn’t use more of that right now? We love helping businesses find the right fit when it comes to digital staffing and we’d love to help you too. Drop us a line anytime to find out more. "

            "body": "2020/09/14 - Hiring for diversity should be a top priority for your company. A survey on diversity hiring found that 67 percent of active and passive job seekers feel that a diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers. “Diversity” in the workplace includes age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and a host of other qualities. Take this anecdote from the former COO of eBay. While visiting a company for a board meeting, Maynard Webb noticed that every new hire was young, white, and male. When he asked why, Webb was given an apologetic answer. “We know this is a problem, but there just isn’t enough pipeline to find other good people now. ” Here’s the thing, though. The issue isn’t “pipeline. ” As Webb points out, half our population is female, half are racially diverse, and young people clearly aren’t the only job seekers. The good news is that diversity hiring strategies can help you see real results. Why do we need hiring diversity?: Your candidate pipeline, statistically speaking, conscious or unconscious, isn’t diverse. If you’re relying on hiring through referrals, you’re likely stifling a diverse candidate pool. Why? Our circles tend to include people who are similar demographically to ourselves. It’s natural for humans to connect with individuals with shared experiences. Yet we need diversity. For one, it’s the right thing to do. And depending upon your industry or geopolitical location, compliance might be mandatory. It’s also the smart thing to do. It benefits you, it benefits your customers, and it drives your success. Uniformity doesn’t breed innovation. A diverse workforce is directly related to increases in collaboration and team-based work in the office. Hiring for diversity benefits you: A 2018 McKinsey report found that companies in the top-quartile for workforce diversity are 33 percent more likely to financially outperform their less diverse counterparts. This can be attributed to several factors. A diverse workforce brings new (and varied) perspectives to your organization. This in turn leads to greater creativity, faster problem-solving, and higher employee engagement. You’ll see lower turnover, better decision-making, a stronger reputation, and higher profits.  “Good leadership requires you to surround yourself with people of diverse perspectives who can disagree with you without fear of retaliation. ”— Doris Kearns Goodwin Constructive feedback and accountability are important. As a leader, how can you push yourself if you’re surrounded by people who agree with your every word? A diverse team will have more effective discussions. That’s the beauty of multiple perspectives. How to introduce more diversity into your organization: Let’s jump back to Wells’ boardroom conversation. The issue isn’t so much convincing companies that diversity needs to be a priority. It’s figuring out how to make it happen. Your diversity hiring strategies should include:  Improving accessibility and breaking down barriers that impede application Increasing awareness (What can you do to educate diverse candidates about available positions? How can you authentically reach this community where they are?) Creating systems of accountability (Maybe you set interview goals for candidates from underrepresented backgrounds) Widening your talent networkHow talent sourcing leads to more diverse hiring practices: Widening your talent network is incredibly important. Why? Talent networks do offer a broader pool of talent that is typically outside of your decision-makers’ circle. Talent sourcing helps you find people that don’t run in the same circles as you. You find people who live life differently than you. These differences might include preferences of platforms, apps, and news outlets, for example. Check out our guide to talent sourcing for a deeper dive into how best to find and network with potential candidates outside of your network. Talent sourcing can make it easier for you to create a more diverse workforce, BUT. Here’s the big asterisk: beware the decision-maker’s bias. Conscious or unconscious, it’s there. Talent sourcing can give you a more diverse talent pipeline. (No more “we’d love to hire diverse candidates but we just don’t see the applicants!”). You’ll have fresh perspectives, variety in age and gender and background and location and race (and the list goes on). Again, though, it’s up to your other hiring policies to see it through. Talent sourcing can improve the diversity of your candidate pool. But you need to also foster an inclusive hiring strategy for your diverse workforce. What it all means: A talent network can’t necessarily help you create a more diverse hiring team. Unfortunately, that bias is up to the decision-maker. It can, however, show you what diversity offers your organization. Talent sourcing is beneficial to workforce diversity. If a company hires from within (or hires only from the network of people they already know), it misses out on opportunities to bring fresh points of view and new ideas. At Esteemed, we’re passionate about improving the hiring process for both talent seekers and employers. One aspect that absolutely needs to be considered here is this conscious effort to seek out new perspectives. The first step, then, is finding a diverse network or pool using talent sourcing.

            "body": "2020/09/09 - Talent sourcing is a valuable tool for successful, forward-thinking companies. As its name suggests, talent sourcing is how you connect with talented colleagues that you might not otherwise cross paths with. It’s a complex dance, especially in the digital age. The recruitment market is now largely candidate-driven. Gone are the days when employees remain with a single employer throughout the entirety of their careers. Today’s best talent seeks the best opportunities for success - wherever that may take them. Factor in our growing remote workforce, and you’ve got a challenge. How do you source talent these days? We’re here to walk you through the intricacies of sourcing prospective digital candidates. Read on to learn about strategies, challenges, tools, and best practices for talent sourcing. These tips can help you avoid bad hires. What is digital talent sourcing?: Digital talent sourcing is the process of discovering and connecting with prospective candidates to develop a network of talented people for hire. The goal is, essentially, to curate and maintain a talent pool. This way, when a new position becomes available, they can be recruited from this source. Rather than starting from scratch every time you look to hire someone new, you develop a reserve. Moving forward, you can recruit for the position from here.  Talent sourcing is the process of identifying, researching, connecting, and networking with prospective candidates. The hope is to then recruit and convert these individuals when a job opening becomes available. Strength in numbers, power in diversity: Why is talent sourcing so useful? For one, it makes your recruiter’s job much easier when a position opens up. You’re not looking for a needle in a haystack — you’re looking for a needle in a bowl of needles. More importantly, though, you’re building diversity. Each new potential candidate that joins your network brings a lot to the table. And you’re not just connecting with one or two individuals, either. Talent sourcing agencies assemble hundreds, if not thousands of top professionals. This diverse pool of potential represents a cohort that will drive innovation and add new skills to future workplaces. If you hire only who you know (and who they, in turn, know), your organization likely limits itself. But, on the other hand, if you rely on a network of sourced talent, you see a much broader demographic. And, as you look to future-proof your workforce, don’t underestimate the power of diverse talent! Workplace diversity appeals to customers and candidates, alike. What are the best talent sourcing strategies?: It comes down to a simple formula. Figure out who you want, find them, and establish a relationship. Let’s break it down: Who should I look for?: Find people who fit the needs and trajectory of your organization. You want to develop a network of talent who can grow with you. It’s important that as you identify the most qualified individuals, you connect with ones whose skills can fill gaps in your present (and future) workforce.  Analyze your current environment: what areas can be improved? Do you find yourself outsourcing certain tasks frequently? Is one skill set oversaturated in your company? Map out your future. What are your big plans? How will you get there, and who will you need in order to make that change happen? Source people for your talent network with these points in mind. Create a candidate version of the buyer persona. A profile, if you will. Give this idealized persona work experience details, interests, and behavioral traits. You’ll want to have a sense of their goals and habits. Know approximately which skills you’d like them to have, how many years of experience in a field or position they hold, what their salary range is, and what priorities they have. Where do they spend time online? What are their interests? These details come in handy as you search for the real-life versions of your persona. How do I find the right people?: Now that you have a general idea of who you’re looking for, how do you find them? Talent is scattered. Many skilled digital professionals are on LinkedIn and other social media platforms, but they’re also out in the real world working for competitors, visiting conventions and meet-ups, and studying on college campuses. Your candidate personas help here. Look to your talent profiling to understand where these candidates are concentrated. Enlist the support of talent sourcing tools, too. Slack, for example, is a great tool for organizations and individuals that share common professional interests. There are channels for everyone: developers, designers, engineers, strategists, and creative tribes to name a few. Looking for developers? Try StackOverflow, an open community “for developers, by developers. ” Join LinkedIn groups and leverage LinkedIn Sales Navigator. This prospecting tool, for anyone not familiar, allows for advanced search filtering. You can look for talent by geographic location, seniority level, role, tenure, industry, and, of course, keywords. Build your talent network with the help of your next job posting. The average corporate job posting has 250 applicants. The 249 that you don’t choose for this position likely still possess the skills and interest you’re looking for (just not for now). Add them to your sourced talent network and don’t forget to touch base with them at least twice a year. How do I establish a relationship?: The best talent is the hardest to reach. How do you connect with your leads, and how can you maintain a relationship? If you’re trying to network with top talent, chances are that many others are doing the same. And if they’re truly as great as you believe them to be, they’re busy. Figure out which channel you’re using to start the conversation. This will depend on your industry and the candidate persona. Where are they most active? Responsive? Some talent sourcing agencies prefer email, others rely on LinkedIn or other forms of social media. Again, consider who it is that you’re talking to, and modify accordingly. Now. How do you handle your first touchpoint? The number one piece of advice we can give here is to connect personally. Nobody likes a generic form email. Personalize your message and don’t be afraid to sound human. Stiff professionalism doesn’t build relationships. Another thing to consider: be respectful of everyone’s time. Keep it short, and don’t demand too much from your prospect from the outset. Talent sourcing best practices dictate that you connect three times. After this, keep your leads warm by reaching out once every six months. Wish them a happy holiday, or remind them that you’re on the lookout for suitable positions. Perhaps you could even share a success story or two. What are the challenges of sourcing tech talent?: The above talent sourcing strategy works across industries and roles. If you’re sourcing tech talent specifically, there are a few challenges you should be prepared to encounter. Esteemed is a talent sourcing agency that manages a talent network of developers, architects, system administrators, UX designers, QA testers, and more. We know a thing or two about sourcing tech talent, and we’re happy to share what we’ve learned over the years. So, what challenges can you expect to face as you source people with tech skills? For one, be prepared to put in more time. There’s a fundamental shortage of engineers and technical management, so demand for tech talent is high. Additionally, you have to be well-versed in the field from which you source. This can get tricky with the more niche tech positions. Before you begin identifying top talent, you need to know the ins and outs of the skill requirements and tell-tale signs of an expert. What’s the difference between talent sourcing and recruiting?: You’ve likely picked up on it by now, but what exactly is the difference between talent sourcing and recruiting? They’re not one and the same, but they are two parts of the same process. The ultimate purpose, for both sourcing and recruiting, is to match talent with open positions. Talent sourcing is the first step in this process: converting non-applicants into applicants. Recruiting converts applicants into hires. They’re both integral parts of any well-oiled talent acquisition strategy. Additionally, while recruiters typically search for talent when a role requires it, talent sourcers seek qualified individuals on an ongoing basis. This way, when a role becomes available, there’s a talent pool already filled with high potential. What does Esteemed do differently?: Esteemed was born out of the realization that talent sourcing doesn’t have to be difficult. Especially tech talent sourcing. Our team already had a history of working with hundreds of engineers, tech managers, project managers, and product managers. We specialize in digital niche categories, roles, skills, and products. (Think Salesforce, Drupal, and Django). We’ve spent a decade building relationships with thousands of digital professionals. From this, we created a talent network of esteemed colleagues who recommend one another as a trusted source. We have a robust talent pool of those we know firsthand, and we also incentivize referrals to connect with thousands more. Here, you get instant access to pre-screened professionals in hard-to-hire specialties. Our main differentiators are our dedication to vetting talent and delivering quality right when you need it. Before any potential candidate is added to our talent network, we have our experienced tech leads screen them. We use Coderbyte to test candidates’ skills. We offer live interview code pairing, custom test questions, and even take-home projects if our client requests it. When you need to hire a contractor, there’s virtually no wait. Esteemed delivers quality options within minutes in cases of common requests. If you need a skilled JavaScript, WordPress, Drupal, or Sitecore professional, we’ll match you almost instantly. If you subscribe, you can connect our talent network to your company’s Slack account. This allows you to message requests on Slack and get results as quickly as if you were messaging your coworker. Final thoughts: Sourcing tech talent doesn’t have to be a chore. If you use the right talent sourcing strategies, you can avoid bad hires. We get it. The workplace and workforce are both becoming increasingly complex. We wholeheartedly believe that everyone deserves access to advice, support, and the right tools.

            "body": "2020/09/02 - As an IT expert, it’s more important than ever to understand the secret ingredients for finding a fit with an employer. One key to that success is the need for “outside the box” traits. Developers aren’t faceless robots in basement cubicles. Employers want their developers to bring their personality, people skills, and emotional intelligence into their work.  “Research conducted with Fortune 500 CEOs by the Stanford Research Institute International and the Carnegie Melon Foundation, found that 75% of long-term job success depends on people skills, while only 25% on technical knowledge. ” —AMA Soft skills are now the greatest complement to your hard skills for retention. It doesn’t matter how fast you can code anymore. You have to be human, too. How can businesses make decisions based on intangibles?: Soft skills have long been undervalued in tech. Analytical skills and quantitative expertise won’t be the only deciding factors for candidates anymore.  “In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand for ‘soft’ social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase with greater demand for ‘hard’ technical skills and tools. ” —PNAS But soft skills are hard to measure. They’re qualities that include things like common sense, how well you mesh with co-workers, and your adaptability to change. And evidence shows that the recommendations of colleagues now play a bigger role in the success of any project. Your soft skills are invaluable to advancing your career. Soft skills can predict success: The future of work demands that we all work smarter across distributed teams. As we connect co-workers around the globe, we’re seeing a new benchmark for team-building. We’re highlighting six soft skills in this blog, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t others that will boost your chances of finding a developer gig. There are dozens of uniquely human qualities and EIQs (emotional intelligence quotients) that will get you hired regularly. Here are some categories you can focus on right now that will make you stand out in the crowd: 6 soft skills developers can improve today: 1. Communication and people skills: This one seems obvious, but now that Slack, Zoom, and Trello have become verbs, it’s the most critical. It’s not just about your emoji and GIF game anymore. You’ll need to brush up on how you speak to colleagues and how you empathize. Not only with your peers, but also end-users and customers. One trick to mastering comms is knowing the best platform to connect on. Sometimes a Slack message thread can be tedious, whereas a phone call can quickly answer your question. Cross-functional teams that work well together will be unstoppable. Teams that hold each other accountable? Even stronger (see below). 2. Teamwork and collaboration: Another one that may seem redundant, but you can’t work in a vacuum. Your teammates will be evaluating not only your tech skills but how accessible and reliable you are. Teams thrive in an environment that offers diversity of thought, constructive criticism, accountability, and that rewards hard work. Clear goals and a growth mindset offer sustainability. Collaboration has never been more critical (see above). Teams need to adapt quickly to weather the many changes ahead. Senior leaders will demand it. 3. Professionalism and work ethic: Not showing up to Zoom calls in the sweats you wore all weekend is a start. But the new normal means showing up with an added focus and initiative. Now that we’re all WFH, efficient time-management will set you apart. It’s easy to get distracted with your kids learning remotely, laundry demanding attention, and Twitter’s 24-hour outrage cycle waiting for you. Take the time to architect your days around how you can make the biggest impact — with the least friction. We understand it’s not easy (we do it every day). 4. Strategic thinking and creativity: With the speed at which technology is changing, we’re all being forced to think on our feet. Developers who can strategically solve problems (especially in a novel way) will be held in high esteem. Creativity is subjective, but taking the time to try new things or learn new languages can pay off big. By staying up-to-date on developments, and even taking a class or two, you’ll be future-proofed. The world needs creative solutions now more than ever. 5. Optimism and patience: As we all tend to be plagued by more stress these days, staying positive is a big plus. Developers can get frustrated with clients and users when things don’t go smoothly. Remaining patient and optimistic helps everyone (and your mental health). Optimism has also been shown to boost self-confidence and be a marker for success. Never forget the power of unplugging for finding your happy place. Taking a walk around the neighborhood is a great fix too (without your phone). 6. Agility and flexibility: We’ve seen the future and it’s agile and iterative. Esteemed has built relationships with thousands of top developers. The common trait in our talent network is adaptability. As new practices and coding languages proliferate, businesses and brands are looking for the best-of-the-best to help them move forward. Developers who show resilience and persistence are sure to be the big winners. Never underestimate the power of simply showing up either. Join our team and get started: It’s okay to not have every soft skill mastered in these challenging times. Personal development is a lifelong process, and we’re here to help. We know that the success of our clients relies on colleagues recommending colleagues. And we have a large network of developers at your disposal to lean on. Let’s start a conversation. Hey, we can all practice our soft skills. Check out the community we’re building today. Esteemed is growing fast, and we’d love for you to join us! "

            "body": "2020/08/11 - Over half of Americans have worked from home this year and many aren’t going back to the office any time soon. Most don’t want to.  “When the pandemic is over, one in six workers is projected to continue working from home or co-working at least two days a week, according to a recent survey by economists at Harvard Business School. ”—The Atlantic In addition to office space costs, new employee distancing regulations, masks, and cramped spaces concern many brands. The traditional office and set hours aren’t ideal for most employees. Especially while commuting and public health are major societal concerns. Agile workforces are the new normal for big tech companies like Google, Twitter, Microsoft, and Facebook. And here’s why… The Inevitable Rise of Remote Talent: Leveraging distributed teams makes perfect sense right now. This surge in “telepresence” is helping businesses to do way more with less.  “The percentage of workers who say their employer is offering them flex time or remote work options has grown from 39% to 57% in the latest polling, conducted March 30-April 2, 2020. ”—Gallup But every business owner knows the true pain points of finding the right hire. The costs of recruitment efforts alone are staggering, averaging $4000 per job in the U. S. Wasted time that could be spent on important projects. The slog of recruiting the best candidates for the job from untrusted talent pools and platforms. The endless assessments. CEOs still report that their biggest concern is hiring talent. Many also report that they think the current drought of talent and skill is the biggest threat to their business. Is Your Approach to Hiring Outdated?: Often the results don’t add up. Good hires seem to be a crapshoot, and your competitors are always trying to steal your best people. Luckily, when you build a distributed team to scale your business, you have access to a global talent pool. The diversity alone improves both culture and retention. It’s why so many successful businesses have updated both their hiring and telework policies. Prospects now consider remote work a big factor in choosing an employer. Top talent gets snatched up fast with perks like time, location, and lifestyle flexibility. Are your recruiting methods causing you to miss out on a highly talented pool of digital employees? Top Global Talent at Your Fingertips: By removing the hurdles of traditional hiring, it’s now simple to access digital superstars. With the adoption of platforms like Zoom, Slack, and Google Meet, your business can quickly adapt to the new normal. Remote hiring has cracked open the field of freelancing, and finding top talent is no longer difficult. Passionate problem-solvers are just a few clicks away. By shifting to hiring remotely, businesses can embrace the future of work. Remote Hiring Doesn’t Have to Be Hard: From screenings to interviews, code assessments to culture fits, savvy businesses are making the most of this sea change in hiring. Unfortunately, talent seems to be scattered far and wide across dozens of hiring platforms. At Esteemed, we know the frustration of staffing and have made it our goal to remove the guesswork. For over a decade, we’ve networked the top talent across an incredible array of disciplines … all remotely.

            "body": "2020/08/05 - A major challenge of digital staffing is helping employees thrive. As we face changes in how we do business, who we hire, and how we hire, are paramount. Work-life balance is important in a time when the world seems unstable. Skilled employees seek creative ways to get work done, both in and out of the office. So how can your business accommodate this new work-life balance and stay on task? What Is Work-Life Balance?: Balancing work, personal time, and family life is different for everyone. With some flexibility, it’s possible to create solutions for workers and employers.  “As we look ahead, it is clear that in order to remain competitive, employers must find ways to offer flexible work options if they want to attract and retain top talent,” said Hank Jackson, president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management. For over a decade, we’ve worked with thousands of digital experts, and we know how hard it is to find the right people. For those hard-to-staff niches — like WordPress and Drupal — retention is even harder. Both Gen Xers and Millenials list telework as a job requirement. For Gen Xers, work-life benefits include remote work and ample vacation time. In five years, Millennials will make up 75% of the workforce. They’re not as frivolous as you think. They see careers as a method for supporting their lifestyle. The office ping-pong table is a thing of the past. Employee Happiness Statistics: The future of work lies in talented, distributed networks of eager problem-solvers. And when asked about how working remotely makes them feel, the results are in:  In a survey from the State of Remote Work 2019 “83% of survey respondents agreed that the ability to work remotely would make them happier. ” Full-time remote workers resoundingly replied that they were 22% happier in their jobs than those who had never worked remotely.  In a report by PGI, 82% of distributed workers reported that telecommuting reduced their stress, and 80% reported that it improved their morale. That boost in morale can make a huge difference to your bottom-line and your peace of mind. Happier Employees Are More Creative: Businesses who rely on distributed workforces see the benefits. Employees work from environments best suited to their tastes or moods. Greater comfort boosts creativity and can lead to innovation. For many at the top of their fields, innovation brings greater job satisfaction. And 1,100 US-based firms reported improved relations between managers and workers after going remote. The Impact of Employee Happiness on Productivity: “Research has shown that employees tend to be happier with flexible work environments. As an added bonus for employers, happier employees tend to be more productive, loyal, and have higher retention rates. ”—TotalWellness AI recruiters and algorithms still can’t find employees who will thrive in your business. The ghosts in the machine can only see so much about a person. We’ve seen other professionals struggle with finding hires, evaluating their core strengths, and endless reviews with unqualified candidates. We understand first-hand the challenges of finding the right talent for the job. But how often has a trusted colleague recommended a great hire? Take the Guesswork Out of Finding Top Talent: The Esteemed Colleagues Community came about from our understanding that truly productive teams are built by word-of-mouth. Colleagues referring colleagues. With access to over 13,000 digital experts and a decade of networking, we see it over and over.

So let us do the heavy lifting and find you top global talent all in one easy-to-use Slack channel. Assembling teams of passionate problem-solvers is our job. Yours is to thrive. "

            "body": "2020/08/04 - Finding a web developer for your company or agency is difficult. As he or she guides the direction of your project, it is important to find a perfect fit. A strong web developer determines the success of your product. However, searching for that perfect developer is exhausting. It costs your business time and money. We understand how challenging digital staffing can be. To get the best results for you or your team, follow our guide to hiring a web developer. Establish Your Budget: Your scope will help determine your web resource needs. For a small month-to-month project, you might just need a part-time support developer. A larger project, for example, might require the creation of specific web or cloud-based infrastructure. Your budget will determine which web skills and services you can afford. Figuring out this step is crucial. Not certain? Esteemed can lend a hand as you’re learning your needs. The right hire will stay on track with your goals and within budget. Determine Your Services: Depending upon your scope, you may want more than a web developer to finish the job. Web developers provide many services, but they specialize in niches. Whether they offer a full-range of services hinges on a few things: Are they a freelancer? Are they a contractor? Part of an agency? Here are some roles and responsibilities of some web-related positions. Web Developers: Web developers build the functionality and features of websites. Front-end web developers focus on client-side development. Back-end developers focus on server-side development. Web Designer: Web designers focus on the look and feel of a website. They rarely program new functions or develop modules for your website. Web Teams: Web teams have developers and designers to fulfill your business’ website goals. Having a web team can ensure quality and efficiency for your project. Search for Your Talent: You can find developers on practice-specific websites. These sites allow filtering and searching based on certain skills. Some will have portfolios for the developers you are searching for. This is a great place to look for any niche skills. Use a job posting site specifically for developers. Why? It ensures you’ll find a developer with the necessary skills for your project. WP Contractors: WP Contractors is perfect for businesses looking for WordPress developers with and without niches. They have job postings as well as different size plans that can help you find the web experts you are looking for. UpWork: If you’re looking for a one-off project like image editing or a quick blog, UpWork is a great platform for satisfying an immediate need. However, you will have to sift through hundreds of profiles in order to accomplish your goals, costing you time and money. Drupal Contractors: Big site? Use Drupal? Drupal Contractors is for web developers that have years of Drupal experience. Browse through their portfolios and skills to find the right Drupal web developer. LinkedIn: Looking for web developers on LinkedIn can be strenuous. As you’re scouting talent, you’ll find developers from around the globe with a variety of different backgrounds. On LinkedIn, be certain you have a vetting process in place to help pre-screen your talent. Esteemed: At Esteemed, we’ve pre-screened our 13,000+ resources in areas like WordPress, Drupal, E-commerce, and UI/UX. Our unique team of distributed, digital experts integrate with your company’s communication networks. Instantly, you are connected with resource managers who will help you get the talent you need to finish your project. Get to Work: Once you’ve chosen your talent, it’s time to start the project. Only working with a web developer? If you don’t have a project manager, you must communicate anticipated due dates and project milestones. Remember this is your project. Trust your developer’s expertise, and let them guide you. Nitpicking can slow down your project. Additionally, make sure to review progress when it is provided. Developers can’t move on with your project until then. If you delay your feedback, you run the risk of delaying your project. Pay Your Developer: Handling contracts without a dedicated hiring resource? Make sure to read the terms of your developer’s contract. Agree on milestones, and continue to provide payment as the project progresses. Set expectations, but be flexible. Hiring a web developer is not always easy, but that doesn’t mean it has to be a bad experience. Hopefully you’ll learn more about your project as you learn more about what different developers are capable of. You’ll also have more time to focus on the things that matter to you, like scaling your business. Once you have a good relationship with the right candidate, they’ll ideally become your client for life! Need help finding that trusted advisor? Talk with us today. "

            "body": "2020/08/04 - Your business or agency may be making a critical decision to hire remote employees to help you grow. But many talented web developers and engineers have a backlog of clients. Just getting in contact with them can be a full-time job. Working with a distributed team may seem daunting, but many companies are already fully remote. We’re seeing the future of work change right before our eyes. But, can employing distributed, remote web developers actually save you money? The short answer? Yes. And it will save you more than just that. Save Yourself the Headache: Time is money. Banging your head against a wall is not how you should be spending it. We understand the frustration of digital staffing. We’ve made it our goal to remove the guesswork and pain points along the journey.

It’s no secret that remote teams work longer hours and are more willing to put in overtime than on-site employees. Job flexibility is something that most top recruits look for today. Global firms and agencies too have reported more positive relationships between managers and remote developers.  “95% of employers say that telework has a high impact on employee retention. ”— PGI. com We see it every day on the happy faces of our clients and the Esteemed Colleagues Community. That’s good business. The Bottom-Line for Your Business or Agency: What is the real bottom-line for your business? Output and efficiency are important factors in your success. That balance is crucial.  “… A typical employer can save an average of $11,000 per half-time telecommuter per year. The primary savings are the result of increased productivity, lower real estate costs, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and better disaster preparedness. ” —Global Workplace Analytics Optimizing that path forward is an important step on the journey. By investing more in your talent, you actually save more. We can’t ignore the evidence. Save money and sanity by staffing smarter. Let Us Do the Heavy Lifting: We’ve been there.

            "body": "2020/08/03 - Times have changed. Even before Covid-19 disrupted workplace behavior, the labor market was transforming. Now, this evolution is in overdrive. One in four American workers use freelancing/independent contracting as either their primary or supplemental source of income, according to a MetLife report. “It’s not just a trend,” the study finds, “it’s a fundamental shift in how our economy operates. ” Even if your company bears all the hallmarks of a traditional workforce, you’re no longer immune to the “gig economy. ” If you’re a traditional employer, your talent pool might be shifting their gaze. If you’re already using contractors, you’re likely facing challenges with finding highly-qualified talent.  As more and more digital experts seek contract employment, it’s grown increasingly time-consuming to find the right person for the job. What is Contract Staffing?: When a full-time hire doesn’t fit a position, contract staffing is an alternative. Contract staffing presents companies with talented people that specialize in a given role or industry. Is your organization experiencing rapid expansion? Do you need additional resources for upcoming projects or roles? Contract staffing connects you with candidates for a specific task or time-frame. Contract staffing suits companies experiencing rapid growth. It’s also an invaluable tool for stable businesses that want top talent at the right price. What Are the Benefits of Contract Staffing?: Traditional staffing is expensive. It’s also tedious, lengthy, and offers no guarantee that you’ll find the right person for the job. You need time to source resumes, recruit in-demand talent, screen for necessary skill sets, and lump in recurring expenses—it all adds up. A Perfectly-Tailored Fit: Contract staffing addresses the pain points of job recruitment, giving you flexibility and scalability. Contractors are the solution to elastic workforces, workloads, and workplaces. When you find yourself short-staffed, you can hire someone with role-specific attributes. When projects end or seasonal efforts dry up, you won’t be stuck with employees who have nothing to do. There are ample problems that stem from having too many or too few employees. Avoid these issues by strengthening your core team with contractors and freelancers. A successful company manages fluctuations and handles change in stride. In our modern world, the workforce is fluid and digitally-savvy. You should be, too. Reduction in Hiring Costs: As the hiring process for contract staffing takes less time, you save big. Recruitment costs less for contractors than full-time employees, too. By partnering with a contract staffing agency, you skip lengthy interviewing and vetting processes with busy decision-makers. You pay your contractors only for the hours they work or jobs they complete, as opposed to salaried positions with benefits. Recurring expenses like healthcare, 401(k) contributions and PTO won’t apply. Where Should I Turn for Contract Staffing Solutions?: There is no centralized source for contractors and freelancers. Talent is scattered. Developers and engineers are on LinkedIn, Indeed, job boards, and working for your competitors. Your touchpoints are overwhelming. Looking for top talent in a sea of choices is no easy feat. Trying to fill a technical position? Work with an industry-specific contract staffing agency, like WP Contractors or Drupal Contractors. It’s better than trying to recruit a developer contractor on your own. Why? Tech staffing differs from other freelance and contractor placement. There’s a fundamental lack of engineers and technical management, making it hard to find your ideal candidate. What Should I Look for in a Contract Staffing Agency?: Looking for a reliable pipeline of qualified professionals? Your best bet is a contract staffing agency. Not all agencies are created equal, however. Here are some questions to ask as you search for the right partner. Are Your Contractors Pre-Screened?: Can anyone with internet access and a resume apply, or is there a more rigorous screening process? The stricter the application procedures, the less work you have to do. What Is Your Area of Expertise?: Many agencies choose to focus their efforts on certain industries or roles. You want an agency that can navigate job-specific challenges and requirements. If you find a trusted partner that you work well with, they can likely assist you in other areas. Try to develop a working relationship so that when you have jobs to fill, your agency knows exactly who you’re looking for. What’s the Hiring Process Like?: When you need help, how quickly can you receive it? Does a fast turnaround time affect the quality of your hire? How many steps must you go through before you see results? Will I Need to Integrate a New Tool or Platform?: If transparency and communication are important to your hiring process, how will your agency contribute to your company goals? Will you be asked to learn new tools? Does this agency work with your existing platforms? At Esteemed, for example, we offer a reliable pipeline of pre-screened individuals that you can tap into from Slack. All you need to do is make requests in your private channel. We’ll connect you with top talent almost instantly. Staffing your organization with contractors and freelancers is cost-effective and well-suited for the modern workplace. Considering the trends in remote work and contract positions, you’re at a competitive disadvantage if you don’t capitalize on this hiring strategy. You can find the best talent at reasonable prices. Best of all, you don’t have to break a sweat if you team up with the right agency. Want to learn more? Get in touch with us today "

Throughout the current economic uncertainty and global pandemic, remote work is on everyone’s mind. But should you embrace it? At first, allowing remote work for your teams and contractors might feel unsettling. But chances are your remote employees will thank you for trusting them to find their ideal working environment. Your business or brand might even see some big results by allowing #remotework. How to Boost Employee Productivity: At Esteemed, we’re on a mission to help people around the world work smarter, not harder. For nearly a decade, we’ve been tracking how remote work positively impacts our network. Our colleagues and clients see the difference too.  “65% of employees believe they’re more productive when they work outside of the office, and 47% wish their company provided this benefit. ”—Marija Kojic, Productivity Writer On the whole, remote teams get more done. And they do it all without a dreadful commute. Why Does Remote Work Help Skyrocket Performance?: WFA (Work from Anywhere) is the new WFH (Work from Home). Workplace elasticity lets you be your own boss, keep flexible hours, and focus on the tasks that matter. Most top-tier developers have avoided the traditional office for years. 44% of remote employees said they were less distracted when they worked from home. No more endless meetings, office distractions, or annoying coworkers. The bedroom is the new boardroom. Employee Productivity Vs. Hours Worked: One misconception about distributed teams is that they work fewer hours than their on-site counterparts. This is simply not true. Remote workers say they work more than 40 hours per week, 43% more than on-site workers. The State of Remote Work Survey discovered the biggest reasons employees choose remote work:  Better work-life balance (91%) Increased productivity/better focus (79%) Less stress (78%) Avoiding a commute (78%)A distributed workforce can elevate a company’s efficiency, as well as boost employee morale and customer satisfaction. With flexible schedules, remote teams no longer need to worry about the yoke of the 9-to-5. Remote Work Productivity: The results are in. If brands want to get to the next level, they need to embrace remote work. At Esteemed, we rub elbows with diverse, global digital rockstars every day. We see the benefits of WFA and distributed teams first-hand. Numerous studies have shown how much more productive, engaged, and effective employees can be when they’re empowered to choose where, when, and how they’ll get work done. Can You Really Measure Employee Productivity?: Productivity metrics and benchmarks will be different for every business. Your productive output and efficiency are important factors to your success, and that balance is delicate. Optimizing that path forward is an important step on the journey, and that’s why we can’t ignore the evidence.  “… A typical employer can save an average of $11,000 per half-time telecommuter per year. The primary savings are the result of increased productivity, lower real estate costs, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and better disaster preparedness. ” —Global Workplace Analytics But more than math, we’ve seen the difference in output first-hand, and the future is bright! If you’re in need of an extra pair of trusted hands, a technical expert, or a strategic advisor with one of your projects, let us know. We’re 13,000+ strong and growing, distributed, and experienced in all things digital. "

Having started an agency in 2011, we have sponsored countless events, amassed an impressive list of clients and formed many relationships with top talent. We’re a community of pre-screened digital professionals spread across multiple disciplines and categories. We have practices focused on CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Sitecore, AEM and more), E-commerce, UX, and Cloud. We deliver our service via the tools our clients already use. Built on Slack, our premier platform allows us to post open roles, communicate, and collaborate with client employers and client providers. We can connect you with a potential hiring manager in minutes. A network of this type removes the burden of business development from a contractor and provides a host of other benefits even for those seeking full-time work. Less Time Searching, More Time Working: The job search process can be long and drawn-out with many interviews, conversations, and redundant screening. Even if you do find a great opportunity, you might repeat the same search process a few months later once your project wraps up. At Esteemed we vouch for you with our clients. To do that we screen and qualify your experience, offer feedback that we think will help, and connect you with new opportunities that will be a fit as they come through our pipeline. Because we’re on Slack, our jobs are posted directly in their respective channels. Looking for new opportunities in Magento, or another related field? Fill out your profile, get in touch, and join the channel for your discipline. Less time searching for jobs means more time focusing on learning new skills or having fun. That’s what we are all about, making work more flexible, abundant and fun. Stand Out from the Crowd: In our years in the digital space we find companies work with who they trust. When you join our Colleagues Community, you’re pre-qualifying yourself for open roles listed with Esteemed. Just by signing up and going through our vetting process you are verifying your skills to one of our leads. Our clients have come to trust these individuals as if they were their own staff. We try to keep the process as minimal as possible, yet a thorough review of everyone in the network is needed to make strong recommendations. From there you have access to mentorship, support, and collaboration with 500 peers. Grow Your Own Network: When you join the Esteemed Colleagues Community, you gain access to hundreds on Slack and thousands in the network at large.

Our Esteemed members are always happy to offer advice, insight, and support. We’re a friendly, open company and we pride ourselves on our ability to build relationships with quality talent and grow lasting connections—whether that be between employer clients or members. Join Our Inside Track: At Esteemed, you can also gain access to opportunities not listed on job sites. More than half of job seekers report that their preferred source for finding jobs is online. The second most popular method? Hearing about jobs from a friend or trusted colleague. We keep a close eye on our current and potential clients, and often hear about their needs first. This means they come to us first before posting on LinkedIn, Indeed, or even on their own website. Because of our unique relationship with agencies and organizations, joining our Colleagues Community might even assist with transforming your skill-set to a new area. For example: a developer who may want to transition to Project Management, or an Executive role. We have helped many in the network transition to related areas. We believe in doing what you love. For some, that can change over time. We are here to help. A Little Help from Your Friends: As a freelancer people can feel lonely, and lack a support system found in traditional settings. Even if you are on contract at a big company, you are still “a contractor. ” Being part of Esteemed provides a large and diverse support system. Whether you are looking for a simple coding solution or a few extra hands, we’re here to help! We know that team camaraderie encourages confidence, increases access to knowledge, and invites shared experiences. We believe being part of our Colleagues Community means not only helping you get gigs, but helping scale and grow your skills. Become a Partner: Finally, although not one of our five reasons to join, we find relationships are everything in the workplace. Our Internal Partners Program provides developers and small agencies of five or less with the resources they need at insider pricing. If you’re a sole developer or an agency who doesn’t want to turn down that big project, let’s talk. Our Colleagues Community is a place to explore opportunities, share ideas, meet new colleagues and join interesting projects. As we bring members from around the world together for collaboration, work, and networking we are committed to help contractors grow their business and those seeking full-time work find the employer of their dreams.

            "body": "2020/07/08 - Whether we want to admit it or not, everything has changed. The future of work, in light of the “new normal,” presents some very unique challenges and solutions. There’s never been a greater opportunity for disruption, but this also means more chances for failure. By being flexible, agile, and empathetic, we all have the best chance to create change, make a difference, and succeed in this new world of work. At Esteemed, we believe that the future of work lies with highly-talented, diverse, and well-trusted teams of distributed workers. Both employers and employees are seizing the opportunities offered by this emerging revolution. The Future Will Be (Evenly) Distributed: A distributed workforce refers to personnel geographically distributed over large areas who make the best use of advanced technology to go beyond the limitations of the traditional working model. Twitter recently announced moving up its timeline to keep much of its workforce remote when they realized the benefits. Not only were employees safer, but they were also happier and more productive. Coming advances in 5G, remote work platforms, video conferencing, VPNs, and a culture that embraces online life, all point to the benefits of a distributed workforce, We’re also ditching the old ways of hiring — that can comprise months of wasted effort — for simple, consolidated staffing solutions. 5 Benefits of Distributed Teams: We understand the frustration of staffing and have made it our goal to remove the guesswork. For over a decade we’ve made it our business to help businesses easily harness the power of distributed workforces to find …  Increased employee productivity Happier employees who are more productive Top global talent at your fingertips Improved culture, loyalty, and retention And a better bottom-line for your business1. Increased Employee Productivity: Employers have been surprised that productivity skyrockets when workers go remote, even part-time. The flexibility of telecommuting has brought an infusion of energy to the workplace. Many top-tier developers have avoided the traditional office for years for good reason. In fact, 44% of remote employees said they were less distracted when they worked from home. 2. Happier Employees Are More Productive: Happy workers get more done. In a survey from the State of Remote Work 2019 “83% of survey respondents agreed that the ability to work remotely would make them happier. ” Not to mention that ~1,100 US-based firms reported improved relations between managers and workers after implementing a remote-work program. 3. Top Global Talent at Your Fingertips: With Esteemed, you can quickly source digital professionals from a pre-vetted pool of global super-stars. Gone are the days of murky job sites, bad leads, unreliable recruiters, and wasted weeks. 4. Improved Culture, Loyalty, and Retention: Now more than ever organizations desire a diversity of voices, global leaders with unique viewpoints, and loyal employees who consider flexibility a benefit. According to a PGI think-piece, 95% of employers say that telework has a high impact on employee retention. 5. The Bottom-Line for Your Business: With the rising costs of office equipment and space, remote employees can save the average business close to $11,000 annually for even a part-time hire. Organizations that have never considered distributed workforces are now facing one simple fact: Adapt, or be left in the dust. The Revolution Will Be Distributed: Looking to transform the workday? If you’re a results-oriented developer or digital professional looking to bolster your portfolio or meet some new and amazing clients, we’d love to meet you! And if you’re an agency or business that wants to tap into our deep talent network, let’s chat. Save yourself time, money, and little bit of sanity in these challenging times. "
