        <p class="card-text">Seven out of every ten companies reportedly use Agile approaches, according to <a
          href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017.pdf">a
          recent global project management survey</a>. Not only is Agile adoption now considered a mainstream business
          practice, but it has an impressive impact.</p>
        <h2 class="u-text-bold text-left margin-top-2">When Should You Turn to Agile Coaching?</h2>
        <p class="card-text">Agile coaching takes many forms. If your team feels as if its daily Scrum isn’t as
          effective as it could be, Agile facilitators can coach your employees directly, and in detail. Alternatively,
          if management isn’t yet convinced of the new method’s potential, an Agile coach can offer executive leadership
          counseling. The removal of top-level resistance will align expectations and improve organizational
          transparency.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Your Agile coach will guide you through the cross-departmental adoption process and educate
          your team(s) along the way. In working with an Agile coach, you will set your business up for a successful
          adoption of Agile processes. As with any project, collaboration is central to a favorable outcome. Your coach
          will facilitate communication and foster collaboration between your teams and business units.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Despite their many benefits, Agile projects aren’t foolproof. They can fail, even if the
          failure rate is <a
            href="https://vitalitychicago.com/blog/agile-projects-are-more-successful-traditional-projects/">nearly
            three times lower</a> than Waterfall. Often, an Agile project’s failure can be directly linked to a lack of
          managerial support. To prevent failed projects and incomplete implementation, hire an Agile coach to assist
          with the transition.</p>
