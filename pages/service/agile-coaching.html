        <p class="card-text">If your team feels as if its daily Scrum isn’t as effective as it could be, our Agile facilitators can coach your employees directly, and in detail. Alternatively, if management isn’t yet convinced of the new method’s potential, an Agile coach can offer executive leadership counseling. By removing any top-level resistance, we can help align expectations and improve organizational transparency.
</p>
        <p class="card-text">As with any project, collaboration is central to a favorable outcome. Your coach will facilitate communication and foster collaboration between your teams and business units. To prevent failed projects and incomplete implementation, hire an Agile coach to assist with the transition.</p>
        <p class="card-text">With Esteemed, you will be matched with the perfect Agile coach who will guide you through the cross-departmental adoption process and educate your team(s) along the way. In working with an Agile coach, you will set your business up for a successful adoption of Agile processes.</p>
