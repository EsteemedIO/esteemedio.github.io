                Technological capabilities develop and transform rapidly. Businesses rely on up-to-date technology to
                remain competitive and perform essential functions. It’s critical then to have a dedicated team member
                at the executive level to evaluate, implement, and manage relevant technology to serve your business
                needs.

                Fractional CTOs engage in executive decision-making and liaise between tech teams and upper
                management, overseeing everything from IT security, technology contracts, scalability, maintenance, and
                daily operations. Companies that work with Fractional CTOs often do so contractually, temporarily, or at
                reduced hours.

        <p class="card-text">For businesses looking to cut costs or compartmentalize technological management, a Fractional CTO
          offers the benefits of a full-time CTO — for a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Unlike full-time CTOs, a Fractional CTO typically concentrates their efforts in
          predetermined areas. Rather than take on the broad responsibilities of their full-time counterparts,
          Fractional CTOs have specialized tasks. A start-up, for example, might hire a Fractional CTO to develop its
          technology roadmap and initial strategy. Companies launching new products or services are known to bring in
          Fractional CTOs long enough for them to see the project through. As organizations navigate a sudden shift to
          remote work, Fractional CTOs are useful resources to address the technological needs and necessary
          implementation requirements.</p>
        <p class="card-text">We have a team of pre-vetted, top-tier, professional Fractional CTOs with industry-specific
          knowledge and skill sets. When you work with Esteemed Talent, you’ll receive a curated list of expert CTOs
          available for immediate hire. This arrangement is cost-effective and improves your time and resource
          efficiency. With our Fractional CTO service, you’ll waste no time on tedious recruiting and onboarding. Our
          team members are capable of quickly addressing your needs and getting up to speed on important projects.</p>
