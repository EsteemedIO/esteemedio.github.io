                Technological capabilities develop and transform rapidly. Businesses rely on up-to-date technology to
                remain competitive and perform essential functions. It’s critical then to have a dedicated team member
                at the executive level to evaluate, implement, and manage relevant technology to serve your business
                needs.

                Fractional CTOs engage in executive decision-making and liaise between tech teams and upper
                management, overseeing everything from IT security, technology contracts, scalability, maintenance, and
                daily operations. Companies that work with Fractional CTOs often do so contractually, temporarily, or at
                reduced hours.

        <p class="card-text">For businesses looking to cut costs or compartmentalize technological management, a Fractional CTO
          offers the benefits of a full-time CTO — for a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Unlike full-time CTOs, a Fractional CTO typically concentrates their efforts in
          predetermined areas. Rather than take on the broad responsibilities of their full-time counterparts,
          Fractional CTOs have specialized tasks. A start-up, for example, might hire a Fractional CTO to develop its
          technology roadmap and initial strategy. Companies launching new products or services are known to bring in
          Fractional CTOs long enough for them to see the project through. As organizations navigate a sudden shift to
          remote work, Fractional CTOs are useful resources to address the technological needs and necessary
          implementation requirements.</p>
        <p class="card-text">We have a team of pre-vetted, top-tier, professional Fractional CTOs with industry-specific
          knowledge and skill sets. When you work with Esteemed Talent, you’ll receive a curated list of expert CTOs
          available for immediate hire. This arrangement is cost-effective and improves your time and resource
          efficiency. With our Fractional CTO service, you’ll waste no time on tedious recruiting and onboarding. Our
          team members are capable of quickly addressing your needs and getting up to speed on important projects.</p>

        <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What is a Fractional CTO?</a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p class="card-text">A fractional CTO is defined as a CTO who manages technology for a company “for a fraction of the time, on a fraction of the projects, and for a fraction of the cost,” compared to their traditional full-time counterpart. There’s no distinction between education level, years of experience, or any other skill – the only difference is that a fractional CTO is essentially an on-demand consultant for specific projects, plans, or technologies.</p>

        <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What does a Fractional CTO do?</a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p class="card-text">There are a host of functions and responsibilities that a fractional CTO takes on, and they generally vary by the company’s industry, size, and maturity.Fractional CTOs typically involve themselves in both the technical aspect (collaborating with developers, overseeing IT maintenance, etc.) and with business development. Sometimes, a fractional CTO will focus exclusively on technology matters. These executives are actively involved in decision-making and play a critical role in connecting upper management with tech teams.</p>

        <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Why should I hire a Fractional CTO?</a>
        <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
          <p class="card-text">Fractional CTOs are added to a company’s upper management when the organization faces challenges with an existing development team. A fractional CTO is a great solution if you require a talented individual to fill the role, but either don’t have the resources to bring on a full-time hire or your business is still growing and doesn’t yet provide enough work for a full-time CTO. With a fractional CTO, you can address precisely the projects you’re prepared to tackle, and you’re getting a seasoned professional with diverse experience (and a fresh perspective!) at a fraction of the cost.</p>
