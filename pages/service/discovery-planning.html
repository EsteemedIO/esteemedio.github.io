      <div class="width-75rem margin-top-3 padding-right-20 padding-left-3">
        <p class="card-text">In business, discovery is the part of a project’s developmental process in which the team
          reflects on which resources you already possess, which still need to be obtained, and what needs to happen in
          order for you to meet your project goals. In essence, you’re planning. During discovery, you’ll learn about
          what you do and do not have and whether this assists in (or prevents you from) completing the project. </p>
        <h2 class="u-text-bold text-left margin-top-2">What do discovery and planning entail?</h2>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text">Planning your project’s strategy isn’t as simple as it sounds. Brainstorming sessions are a
          useful tool in your discovery and planning stage, but without proper direction, your team risks hyper-fixating
          on a single element of your project’s scope or, conversely, taking on an overly-ambitious vision. In striking
          a balance between your wants and needs, and by adjusting the lens with which you view the extent of your
          project, you’ll create a strong foundation to build upon.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Discovery and planning offer insights and enable your team to set expectations. It’s a
          strategic step used by top organizations from a project’s outset to bring stakeholders together to improve
          communication and transparency. We’ll speak with all collaborators to glean expectations and research the
          current state of business. Your consultant will guide your team through the research process, defining KPIs,
          requirements, and potential pain points.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Discovery and planning involves a qualitative and quantitative approach to develop your
          project’s optimal strategy. When finished, your team will have a project roadmap that will lead you to your
          end goal(s).</p>
        <p class="card-text">When beginning a new project, don’t pass on laying important groundwork. Foregoing the
          first steps can have serious repercussions down the line. Rather than jumping in blindly, take the time for
          discovery and planning. We offer Esteemed project managers and consultants to our clients as they embark on
          new projects.</p>
