  description: "The workplace is undergoing a transformation. A shift from Employer-
    to Employee-driven has taken hold. As permanent and contract workers are increasing,
    so are hybrid and remote workplaces. With all these changes, developing a human
    workplace, or, a people and remote-first culture, presents challenges. \n\nBusinesses
    are in need of adjusting their thinking, practices and tools. We help organizations
    navigate this journey."
