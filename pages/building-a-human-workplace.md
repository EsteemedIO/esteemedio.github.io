  description: "When you are focused on growing your business, it can be difficult
    to build culture. As business requirements and ecosystems rapidly change, businesses
    can become reactive to their environments. \n\nIntentionally building an inclusive,
    purpose-driven culture has been shown to unlock the potential of the workforce
    by putting people at the center of decision-making. Your workforce will have greater
    impact when they are trusted to bring their competencies to the table."
